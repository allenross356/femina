The challenge for this month overall is to work with at least one hour worth of WordCamp video, which you can do by either creating subtitles or editing the video file in preparation for upload to <a href="http://WordPress.tv">WordPress.tv</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the great things about contributing to the video team is that you get to learn so much, since all the work basically involves watching WordCamp presentation videos. Subtitling is a doubly important need, as it is needed to make all those WordCamp videos accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing and can&#8217;t listen to the audio track, as well as making it possible for the videos to be consumed (in some cases after subtitle translation) by people who speak different languages.</p>\n<p>The challenge will last from Saturday, February 27, 2016 through Sunday, February 28, 2016, and the results will be reviewed afterward by members of the video team.

That challenge had 73 participants, including 10 people who provided 20 or more correct answers to open support threads, thereby winning the challenge. Congratulations to Harris Anastasiadis, Ahmad Awais, Takis Bouyouris, Phil Erb, Eric Gunawan, Jackie McBride, Diana Nichols, Kostas Nicolacopoulos, Juhi Saxena, and Sarah Semark! To them and to everyone else who participated, thank you <strong>so much</strong> for your efforts. Every answer helps, and over the course of this contributor weekend, these amazing volunteers responded to <strong>800 support threads</strong>. The support forums queue of requests with no replies went from 28 pages to 7 pages &#8212; that was an incredible success, of which every participant was a part!</p>\n<p>So head on over to see how to <a href="https://wp.me/P6onIa-28D">get involved with the one-hour video challenge</a> this weekend, and help us make next month&#8217;s post just as impressive! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:41:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n	\n\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"WordPress 4.5 Beta 1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/02/wordpress-4-5-beta-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 03:27:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Development";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"4.5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4080";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:329:"WordPress 4.5 Beta 1 is now available!

We emphasize that WordCamps are locally-organized events, not something that the central <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community">community team</a> plans from afar.</p>\n<p>This has been successful in many areas &#8212; there are currently 241 meetup groups on our meetup.com chapter program! In some regions, though, enthusiastic volunteers have had more of a challenge getting things started. Because of this, we&#8217;re going to try an experiment this year called the WordCamp Incubator.</p>\n<p>The intention of the incubator program is to help spread WordPress to underserved areas through providing more significant organizing support for a first event. In practical terms, this experiment means we&#8217;ll be choosing three cities in 2016 where there is not an active WordPress community &#8212; but where it seems like there is a lot of potential and where there are some people excited to become organizers &#8212; and will help to organize their first WordCamp. These WordCamps will be small, one-day, one-track events geared toward the goal of generating interest and getting people involved in creating an ongoing local community.*</p>\n<p>So, where should we do these three events?  If you have always wanted a WordCamp in your city but haven&#8217;t been able to get a meetup group going, this is a great opportunity. We will be taking applications for the next week, then will get in touch with everyone who applied to discuss the possibilities. We will announce the  cities chosen by the end of March.</p>\n<p>To apply, <a href="http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-application">fill in the application</a> by February 26, 2016. You don&#8217;t need to have any specific information handy, it&#8217;s just a form to let us know you&#8217;re interested. You can apply to nominate your city even if you don&#8217;t want to be the main organizer, but for this experiment  we will need local liaisons and volunteers, so please only nominate cities where you live or work so that we have at least one local connection to begin.</p>\n<p>Thanks, and good luck!</p>\n<p><em><strong>* </strong>For the record, that describes the ideal first WordCamp even if you have an active meetup &#8212; there&#8217;s no need to wait until your group is big enough to support a large multi-day event, and small events are a lot of fun because everyone has a chance to be involved and get to know most of the other attendees.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:36:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"WordPress 4.4.2 Security and Maintenance Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/02/wordpress-4-4-2-security-and-maintenance-release/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 02 Feb 2016 17:57:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Security";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4065";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:375:"WordPress 4.4.2 is now available.

Automattic partnered with Facebook and VIP-Featured-Partner agency <a href="https://en.dekode.no/?noredirect=en_US" target="_blank">Dekode</a> to produce a plugin that outputs a compliant feed of posts wrapped in the required markup for Facebook.</p>\n<p>Instant Articles for WordPress is now <a href="https://vip.wordpress.com/2016/03/07/new-wordpress-plugin-for-facebook-instant-articles/" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a> and is also coming soon to the WordPress plugin directory.</p>\n<p>Publishers must go through a review process to ensure that their posts are properly formatted and compliant before being allowed to push content via Instant Articles. Once approved, articles will load nearly instantly on mobile devices. According to Facebook, the speed is as much as 10 times faster than the standard mobile web.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We had heard from a lot of WordPress publishers that they were eager to try out the Instant Articles program — based on the speed and user experience optimized for Facebook&#8217;s audience,&#8221; VP of Platform Services at Automattic Paul Maiorana said. &#8220;It&#8217;s still quite early, but we wanted to move quickly to ensure that WordPress and WordPress.com VIP publishers can take advantage of Instant Articles as soon as it opens up to everyone. And we were excited to work with Facebook to help make that happen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Facebook is working to create the best news feed on the web. More content delivered instantly means more advertising revenue for the social network. Publishers that make their content available via Instant Articles also have the opportunity to earn advertising revenue. If publishers sell their own ads, they get to keep 100% of the revenue. If they opt to use the Facebook Audience Network, they keep 70%.</p>\n<p>Automattic&#8217;s open source Instant Articles plugin does not have built-in options for serving ads. According to Maiorana, further customization will be left up to the publishers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The new plugin is meant to be a starting point for publishers, from which they can customize design, advertising options, and which articles they choose to syndicate,&#8221; Maiorana said.</p>\n<p>Instant Articles is not yet available to WordPress.com users, but Maiorana said that it&#8217;s something they will explore in the future.</p>\n<h3>Instant Articles Is Geared Towards News Publishers</h3>\n<p>You may be wondering if your brand or business should use the new plugin and start pursuing the approval process with Facebook. The current implementation of Instant Articles is not for everyone. A Facebook spokesperson told <a href="https://contently.com/strategist/2016/02/17/facebook-will-likely-open-instant-articles-to-brands-publishers-grandma/#footnote-1" target="_blank">Contently</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In April, Instant Articles will be open to any publishers that wish to join, but it is primarily designed for news publishers. While other types of publishers will have the option to create Instant Articles, in many cases there are other formats on Facebook that will better serve their needs.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s algorithm is likely to prioritize Instant Articles, as faster-loading articles are shared more often.</p>\n<p>However, publishing to Instant Articles requires no small amount of technical skill, especially if you&#8217;re not already on a platform like WordPress that offers support via a plugin. Even with the help of Automattic&#8217;s plugin you still need to make a number of customizations to add branding and advertising while the underlying APIs are still in flux.</p>\n<p>Publishers will need to decide how much control of their content they are willing to give up to Facebook in exchange for articles that load instantly. Funneling readers to Instant Articles hosted on Facebook has the potential to undermine direct mobile traffic. Facebook is also <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/04/technology/online-censorship-facebook-twitter/" target="_blank">notorious for its censorship</a>. What will Automattic&#8217;s response be to its partner if Facebook decides to censor WordPress publishers on its network? Maiorana wouldn&#8217;t directly answer this question.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our goal at WordPress.com VIP is to help publishers have the tools and the freedom to make their own decisions — and to move quickly in experimenting across platforms,&#8221; Maiorana said. &#8220;This is another new way for them to do that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>New mobile publishing channels like Instant Articles and <a href="http://wptavern.com/automattic-adds-amp-support-to-wordpress-com-releases-plugin-for-self-hosted-sites" target="_blank">Google&#8217;s AMP project</a> require developer resources for publishers to get on board. Both of these tech giants are clawing for content distribution. They each have their own unique requirements that publishers will have to meet to in order to have their content found and prioritized. Each publisher will have to decide whether the improved speed, exposure, and/or ad revenue will be enough to make these efforts worthwhile.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 07 Mar 2016 21:30:58 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"WPTavern: The Inaugural WPCampus Set For July 15-16, 2016";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52130";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"http://wptavern.com/the-inaugural-wpcampus-set-for-july-15-16-2016";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1550:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WPCampusFeaturedImage.png" rel="attachment wp-att-48353"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48353" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/WPCampusFeaturedImage.png?resize=811%2C161" alt="WPCampus Featured Image" /></a><a href="https://2016.wpcampus.org/">WPCampus</a>, a WordPress event geared towards non-profits and higher education, will take place on July 15-16, 2016 in Sarasota, FL at the <a href="https://2016.wpcampus.org/location/">University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee</a> campus.

This is due in large part to <a href="http://wptavern.com/behind-the-scenes-in-the-wordpress-plugin-directory-with-mika-epstein">the dedication of volunteers</a> who act as gatekeepers and review plugins before they&#8217;re added to the directory. Plugin updates, however don&#8217;t receive the same scrutiny as there&#8217;s too many of them.</p>\n<p>Sucuri Security representative Denis Sinegubko, <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2016/03/when-wordpress-plugin-goes-bad.html">published an in-depth post</a> that explains how an update to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-content-type-manager/">Custom Content Type Manager</a> plugin, which is active on more than 10k sites, turned into a security nightmare for some users. Custom Content Type Manager enables users to create custom fields for dropdowns, images, and more.</p>\n<p>According to Sinegubko, a user by the name of Wooranker was added as a maintainer on February 5th. Wooranker is also listed as a contributor to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/postie/">Postie plugin</a> but <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2016/03/when-wordpress-plugin-goes-bad.html#comment-2552555345">according to its author</a>, Wooranker does not and will not have access to change the source code. On February 19th, Wooranker <a href="https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/1354314/custom-content-type-manager">pushed out an update</a> that included the CCTM_Communicator.php file and inserted new code into the plugin’s index.php file.</p>\n<p>On March 1st, MartinCDS <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/vulnerability-on-auto-updatephp">created a thread</a> in the plugin&#8217;s support forums and reported the following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I recently updated a few of my sites and since then my site was hacked. According to my log files the code was injected via custom-content-type-manager/auto-update.php. I navigated there and there is a form input. Please fix this in the next update. I don&#8217;t see a reason for an automatic update anyways- this is a known vulnerability by hackers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Other users also reported that their sites had been hacked due to the auto-update.php file. This file allowed the attacker to upload a c.php file into the plugin directory. The c.php file was used to create a more sophisticated attack shell named wp-options.php in the site&#8217;s root directory. The c.php file was deleted once wp-options.php was created, making it harder to detect.</p>\n<h2>Custom Content Type Manager is Fixed</h2>\n<p>Samuel &#8216;Otto&#8217; Wood, who helps maintain WordPress.org, <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2016/03/when-wordpress-plugin-goes-bad.html#comment-2553534185">left a comment on the article</a> acknowledging that the plugin has been fixed on the directory:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The plugin has been updated to 0.9.8.9, which is a copy of 0.9.8.6 (the last good version). This will remove the malicious code from the plugin, but not any code that was added to sites in the meantime. Please follow through with the Mitigation steps given by Denis in the post.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To learn how the attack works, insight into who Wooranker may be, and to see a list of mitigation steps, I encourage you to <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2016/03/when-wordpress-plugin-goes-bad.html">read the post</a>.</p>\n<h2>A Concerning Reminder</h2>\n<p>I feel bad for those who updated their plugins from a trusted source only to make their sites vulnerable to attack. Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent situations like these from occurring unless every line of code for each update is scrutinized by a security professional, but that doesn&#8217;t scale.</p>\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t detract the trust I have for the WordPress plugin directory but users need to realize that what happened with Custom Content Type Manager can happen to other plugins as well. Your best defense is to use security scanning software of your choice that keeps track of file changes and to make routine backups.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 07 Mar 2016 19:49:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:27:"Matt: Irish Times Interview";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46328";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"https://ma.tt/2016/03/irish-times-interview/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:208:"<p>An interview <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/matt-mullenweg-how-wordpress-got-the-whole-world-blogging-1.2558828">I did with the Irish Times when I was in Dublin is now live</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 07 Mar 2016 19:32:45 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"WPTavern: Magnus: A Bold New Photoblogging Theme for WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=52061";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"http://wptavern.com/magnus-a-bold-new-photoblogging-theme-for-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3831:"<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/magnus/" target="_blank">Magnus</a> is a beautiful new photoblogging theme that landed in the WordPress Theme Directory last week. It was created by <a href="http://hugobaeta.com/" target="_blank">Hugo Baeta</a>, whose work you may have seen in the <a href="https://wordpress.com/design-handbook/" target="_blank">WordPress.com design handbook</a> and last year&#8217;s <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-introduces-subtle-refinements-to-the-default-admin-color-scheme" target="_blank">subtle refinements to the default admin color scheme</a>. Magnus is Baeta&#8217;s first theme to be approved for the official directory.</p>\n<p>The theme puts the spotlight on your photographs with full-width featured images for posts. If the homepage is set to display posts, the most recent post&#8217;s title and featured image will show at the top of the page.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/magnus-home-menu.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52076"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/magnus-home-menu.png?resize=1025%2C573" alt="magnus-home-menu" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52076" /></a></p>\n<p>Baeta applied a unique pulse effect to the full-width images using CSS3 keyframes animation with the scale property. The resulting effect almost makes it appear as though you are traveling through the image. The theme also includes several other subtle, tasteful CSS animations for menus, toggling, and page transitions.</p>\n<p>If the homepage is set to display posts, they will tile uniformly under the most recent one with titles and featured images.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/magnus.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52073"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/magnus.png?resize=1025%2C1408" alt="magnus" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52073" /></a></p>\n<p>Baeta&#8217;s careful attention to typography is evident in the highly readable single post design.  Magnus uses a combination of Google fonts &#8211; Karla for paragraph text and Montserrat for headers.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/single-post.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52074"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/single-post.png?resize=1025%2C666" alt="single-post" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52074" /></a></p>\n<p>The theme includes one widgetized area, a sidebar that can be toggled into view from the right side of the screen. The sidebar slides smoothly into view and is semi-transparent, which makes for a less jarring experience than other similar sidebar implementations.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/magnus-sidebar.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52072"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/magnus-sidebar.png?resize=1025%2C510" alt="magnus-sidebar" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52072" /></a></p>\n<p>Left, right, and centered overhanging pull quotes can be easily created by aligning blockquotes to either side or the center.</p>\n<p>One thing I appreciate about this theme is that it makes almost all of the design decisions and allows very few design-related customizer options. You can change the header image and the header text color, but that&#8217;s it. The design is all about showcasing your images.</p>\n<p>If you need your content to make a big impact, <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/magnus/" target="_blank">Magnus</a> is solid option that doesn&#8217;t require configuring a long list of options. You can <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/magnus/" target="_blank">download it for free from WordPress.org</a> or via your admin themes browser.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 07 Mar 2016 16:16:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 224 – Preview of WordPress 4.5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://wptavern.com?p=52049&preview_id=52049";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-224-preview-of-wordpress-4-5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2586:"<p>In our first episode in more than a month, <a href="http://marcuscouch.com/">Marcus Couch</a> and I discuss the latest WordPress news, including a preview of WordPress 4.5.

This post is part of a new series where I share an assortment of items related to WordPress that caught my eye but didn&#8217;t make it into a full post.</p>\n<h2>Automattic Stands with Apple</h2>\n<p>In light of the recent court order issued against Apple in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/technology/apple-timothy-cook-fbi-san-bernardino.html?_r=0">San Bernardino case</a>, Automattic has <a href="https://transparency.automattic.com/2016/03/03/automattic-and-wordpress-com-stand-with-apple-to-support-digital-security/">taken a stand</a> with Apple by joining other influential technology companies in filing an amicus brief in support of Apple’s legal challenge.</p>\n<p>The court order requires Apple to write code that acts as a backdoor and weakens security on iPhones. Automattic&#8217;s transparency blog explains why they&#8217;re siding with Apple:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Like Apple, we respect the rule of law, and honor the valid government orders we receive to furnish data in connection with criminal investigations. But deliberately weakening information security, as Apple has been asked to do here, is a step too far that makes everyone less safe.</p>\n<p>Undermining security measures – even in situations where there appear to be good intentions – will inevitably have unintended consequences for regular people.</p>\n<p>We stand with Apple in both condemning terrorism and defending the privacy and security of our users. If Automattic was faced with a government order like the one issued in San Bernadino, we, like Apple, would do everything within the law to challenge it. That’s why we’re joining with a sizable group of leading tech companies today to support Apple in this case.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to learn more about why the court order is a terrible idea, check out the <a href="https://cloudup.com/iZG9vzAV3U3">full legal brief</a> submitted by Automattic to the United States District Court.</p>\n<h2>The Ethics of Sharing GPL Code</h2>\n<p>Tom McFarlin shares his thoughts on working with clients, educating people, and <a href="https://tommcfarlin.com/sharing-gpl-code/">sharing GPL code</a> from client projects. If you&#8217;re a consultant, how do you convince clients to give you permission to release code they pay for and you write to the public under the GPL?</p>\n<p>After reading the post, <a href="https://tommcfarlin.com/sharing-gpl-code/#comment-881900">check out this comment</a> left by Darrinb.</p>\n<h2>Gravity Forms Becomes 2nd Gold Partner</h2>\n<p>Around this time last year, Scott Kingsley Clark <a href="http://wptavern.com/pods-lead-developer-scott-kingsley-clark-launches-friends-of-pods-funding-campaign">launched a new sponsorship program</a> called Friends of Pods. The funding is used to decrease private development of Pods and focus more on Pods core, related plugins, and integrations. Gravity Forms, the popular form creation plugin created by Rocketgenius is the <a href="http://pods.io/2016/03/04/announcing-our-2nd-gold-partner-gravity-forms/">second gold partner</a> in the program.</p>\n<p>In addition to the partnership news, the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pods-gravity-forms/">Pods Gravity Forms add-on</a> is now available on the WordPress plugin directory.</p>\n<h2>ActiveDen is No More</h2>\n<p><a href="http://activeden.net/">ActiveDen</a>, a site where people could sell Flash assets and was the first site in the Envato Marketplace has officially closed its doors. The company <a href="http://inside.envato.com/farewell-activeden/">shut it down</a> in order to focus on things that have more impact.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ActiveDenShutsDown.png" rel="attachment wp-att-52052"><img class="size-full wp-image-52052" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ActiveDenShutsDown.png?resize=812%2C303" alt="ActiveDen Shuts Down" /></a>ActiveDen Shuts Down\n<p>To learn more about the history of ActiveDen, I encourage you to watch this 45 minute video featuring Collis Ta&#8217;eed where he talks about the first six months of Envato.</p>\n<div class="embed-wrap"></div>\n<h2>SIDEKICK Partners With ThemeForest</h2>\n<p><a href="https://www.sidekick.pro/updates/sidekick-teams-themeforest/">SIDEKICK announced</a> it is in a trial partnership with 19 ThemeForest authors. The partnership enables customers to view interactive tutorials from within the WordPress dashboard. According to the announcement, the test aims to alleviate some support pain for authors.</p>\n<h2>Calypso&#8217;s Contributor Code of Conduct</h2>\n<p>Codes of Conduct are not limited to events. Many open source projects have implemented them as a way to provide a base line of expectations from those who participate in the project. WordPress core contributor, Ryan Boren, shared a link to <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md">Calypso&#8217;s Code of Conduct</a> on Github which explains the expectations project maintainers have of contributors.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Open source contribution is onboarding flow 4 the future of work in a software eaten world.

It&#8217;s another post in a series from Jacobs on the issue of handling dependencies in WordPress.</p>\n<h2>WordImpress and Media Temple Partnership</h2>\n<p>The WordImpress team <a href="https://wordimpress.com/announcing-wordimpres-media-temple-community-consultants/">announced on its site</a> that it has partnered with Media Temple as WordPress Community Consultants. In exchange for information about customer needs, Media Temple is enabling the team to sponsor, attend, and speak at more WordCamps this year.</p>\n<h2>Happy Birthday Wapuu!</h2>\n<p>In what is a traditional part of this series, I end each issue featuring a Wapuu design. For those who don&#8217;t know, Wapuu is the <a href="http://wapuu.jp/2015/12/12/wapuu-origins/">unofficial mascot</a> of the WordPress project.</p>\n<p>In honor of <a href="http://wapuu.jp/2016/02/18/happy-birthday-wapuu/">Wapuu&#8217;s recent birthday</a> which is February 19th, I present Birthday Wapuu.

Unfortunately, days after the announcement, <a href="http://wptavern.com/alex-king-founder-of-crowd-favorite-passes-away">King passed away</a> from colon cancer.</p>\n<p>Due to health reasons, King would not have been able to attend the event in person. Instead, Strebel flew to King&#8217;s house and <a href="http://pressnomics.com/2016/03/our-interview-with-alex-king/">recorded a 40 minute bedside interview</a>.

MD5&#8217;s known and exploited weaknesses have rendered it &#8220;cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use,&#8221; according to the CMU Software Engineering Institute.</p>\n<p>In a <a href="https://roots.io/improving-wordpress-password-security/" target="_blank">post</a> announcing the plugin, Scott Walkinshaw explained why WordPress&#8217; default MD5 hashing function + salting is insecure:</p>\n<blockquote><p>MD5 is considered &#8220;broken&#8221; due to its collision vulnerability, but it’s broken more fundamentally for passwords: it’s too cheap and fast to calculate a hash.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt" target="_blank">bcrypt</a>, on the other hand, is much slower than MD5, making it more expensive to calculate. This stronger method of password hashing is built into PHP 5.5, but WordPress maintains 5.2.4 as its minimum required version. This precludes WordPress from using the newer password_hash function.</p>\n<p>Walkinshaw cites a four year old <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21022" target="_blank">ticket</a> which proposes a way for WordPress to allow plugin developers to more easily change from the salted MD5 method of hashing to the more secure bcrypt. James McKay left a sobering <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21022#comment:8" target="_blank">comment</a> on that ticket, advocating that WordPress core move to make bcrypt the default for environments that support it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>bcrypt needs to be made the default, out of the box option on all systems that support it. The idea that WordPress admins should have to go hunting for a plugin or tweak configuration options to do this scares me, simply because most of them won&#8217;t unless (a) they are well versed in web security, (b) they know that WordPress uses a weak alternative by default, and (c) they consider it to be an issue worth worrying about.</p>\n<p>People often underestimate the seriousness of MD5 and the SHA-* algorithms being &#8220;less secure.&#8221; They aren&#8217;t just less secure: thanks to developments in password cracking in the past few years using GPU- and FPGA- based software, they are <a href="https://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/" target="_blank">totally useless</a>. Programs such as oclHashCat even have an option specifically to crack passwords in WordPress databases &#8212; and the rate at which they can do so is terrifying. If you&#8217;re not making a strong password hashing algorithm the default, out of the box option, you&#8217;re exposing your users to unacceptable and unnecessary risk.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, action on the ticket has been held up due to a UX issue. Discussion on the ticket continues, but contributors have not yet settled on a path for improvement.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So what is holding up the switch?&#8221; Walkinshaw said. &#8220;Bureaucracy and the unwillingness to make it happen. The consensus of the ticket is that it’s actually a UX problem. At this point, there is no technical reason why this can’t be done.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the meantime, if you want to implement secure bcrypt hashed passwords, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/roots/wp-password-bcrypt" target="_blank">wp-password-bcrypt</a> plugin from the Roots team. It will protect against database compromises. If your WP database fell into the wrong hands, attackers would have a much more difficult time attempting to brute force a bcrypted password versus a MD5-based password.</p>\n<p>The plugin re-hashes user passwords with bcrypt when users log in.

Members of the WordPress Northern Ireland meetup group are collaborating with the Dublin meetup to organize an event in Belfast in September 2016 and one in Dublin in April 2017. The dates have not yet been set in stone but organizers are looking at venues and are gathering all the details and costs to begin work on a budget.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ever since first setting up the WordPress Meetup group in January 2014, a WordCamp was always something that we wanted to see – when the time was right,&#8221; organizer Mark Smallman said. &#8220;Having had the meetup group running successfully for two years, and having been in communication with the Dublin group, we decided the time was right to explore the possibility of running a WordCamp.&#8221;</p>\n<p>John Walsh, co-organizer of the Dublin WordPress Meetup Group, has applied to be the lead organizer of WordCamp Dublin 2017.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The goal is to combine our resources and work together to achieve the common goal of bringing WordCamp to Dublin and to Belfast on an annual basis,&#8221; Walsh said. &#8220;Separately, we have a certain capability but by working together we can accomplish a lot more.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since neither of the two groups has previously hosted or planned a WordCamp, Smallman said that it&#8217;s a steep learning curve for all of them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It helps to have as many and as varied a range of skills as possible on-board to help us get to the summit,&#8221; Smallman said. &#8220;We hope that once we have #WCBelfast in full swing, some of the same organizing team members can either offer assistance to WordCamp Dublin or take on roles directly within their organizing team. This should help both WordCamps in terms of planning for the future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Smallman said that if both WordCamps are a success, the teams will look at the possibility of alternating between Belfast and Dublin in future years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Having a team that is spread over the two areas will also help to widen the net of possible speakers, sponsors and attendees for both WordCamps, hopefully helping to make both a success,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And who knows, possibly both will become regular events on the WordCamp calendar.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The Wapuu of the North: Growing the Community Spirit in Belfast</h3>\n<p>Smallman and the organizing team hope the two WordCamps will help to validate and grow the unique WordPress communities on both sides of the border.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Belfast and Northern Ireland have a wide range of very skilled people in the I.T. sector,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But up until recently it was lacking when it comes to community spirit within the sector. Slowly, we have seen groups within the area grow and now we have thriving Blogging and PHP groups as well as many others.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/belfast_wapuu.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-52005"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/belfast_wapuu.jpg?resize=300%2C300" alt="belfast_wapuu" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-52005" /></a>As an expression of community spirit, the Belfast organizing team has already created a wapuu mascot for the event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Wapuu of the North was generously created by Peter of <a href="http://1440design.com/wordpress/branding-wordcamp-belfast/" target="_blank">1440 Design</a> in Belfast,&#8221; Smallman said. &#8220;Peter works along side <a href="https://twitter.com/se_nelson" target="_blank">Sam Nelson</a> who is on our organizing team. Sam also created our #WCBelfast badge.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We chatted and bounced a few ideas around for a theme for the WordCamp,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Game of Thrones was a very obvious choice, and one that none of us could think of a better fit. Northern Ireland has no fewer than a dozen filming locations for the show. We all thought that we could not choose anyone better than the Wapuu of the North to deliver the message that the White Walkers (developers) were on their way!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Smallman said the team is excited about the venue they&#8217;ve selected for hosting Northern Ireland&#8217;s very first WordCamp.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With all being well, we really are planning something very special for our first WordCamp,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We cannot wait to get moving onto the next stage.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 03 Mar 2016 10:00:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"WPTavern: BuddyPress 2.5.0 Released, Features Customizable Emails and Support for Emoji";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51957";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:96:"http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-5-0-released-features-customizable-emails-and-support-for-emoji";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2990:"<p>BuddyPress 2.5.0 &#8220;Medici&#8221; was <a href="https://buddypress.org/2016/03/buddypress-2-5-0/" target="_blank">released</a> today, named for <a href="http://www.medici57.com/" target="_blank">Medici on 57th</a>, a Chicago restaurant famous among BP contributors for its &#8220;Garbage Pizza.&#8221; The new <a href="https://codex.buddypress.org/emails/" target="_blank">BP Email API</a> is the highlight of the release.

Last July contributors on the project <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/10/feature-plugin-chat-on-july-14/#comment-26310" target="_blank">opened the discussion</a> on a post calling for feature plugins, and the upcoming 3.0 version is being developed with this path in mind.</p>\n<p>Developers use TGMPA to manage dependencies between plugins and themes, as an alternative to bundling a heap of plugin-type functionality into one extension. It walks users through the process of installing plugin dependencies that are required or recommended by the developer. The library is used by 6% of WordPress.org themes as well as a large number of commercial products hosted on CodeCanyon and Themeforest.</p>\n<p>TGMPA will require a substantial rewrite in order to make it ready for consideration as a feature plugin. It also needs to be multisite compatible, address a number of usability issues, and be trimmed of extra features to become leaner and more core friendly.</p>\n<p>The team behind the project has a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1dGb8s2poPWbCGPBPLn5sDDxSulNRYit7vF_-rsk5V6M/viewform?c=0&w=1" target="_blank">survey</a> open to solicit opinions from the community regarding the implementation of these changes. A few sample considerations from the survey include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What method should the plugin use to supply dependency information to multisite independently of whether a theme or plugin is active?</li>\n<li>How should the plugin deal with themes and plugins which haven&#8217;t yet upgraded to the newer version of TGMPA?</li>\n<li>Should the plugin support plugin download sources other than wordpress.org?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;To me it feels like we need more core team support for it to be properly considered for feature plugin status, so some lobbying behind the scenes is in order,&#8221; TGMPA lead developer <a href="https://twitter.com/jrf_nl" target="_blank">Juliette Reinders Folmer</a> told the Tavern. &#8220;The survey is also part of this as that will give us hard data to use in the discussions.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The Future of TGMPA Is a More Modular Architecture</h3>\n<p>Folmer said that regardless of whether TGMPA is approved to become a feature plugin, future development will continue with core in mind.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Development for v3 will be a lot more modular,&#8221; Folmer said. &#8220;TGMPA currently is effectively one file with four classes. That makes it easy to include it in themes and plugins (one file), but not as easy to maintain. As v3 will contain some big changes, this seems like a good point in time to change the structure of TGMPA as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With a more modular approach in place, Folmer said that the team plans to split the package into a number of different repositories for development purposes. She has tentatively identified features that would be offered in the core module, and everything else would be supported via add-on modules, i.e.:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>support for bundled plugins</li>\n<li>support for non-wp.org download urls</li>\n<li>support for recommended plugins</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TGMPA would also introduce two wrappers &#8211; each would function as a layer that will load all the available modules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>one for continued support for including TGMPA in plugins and themes</li>\n<li>one for TGMPA as a feature plugin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;So no matter what will be decided concerning whether TGMPA will be allowed to become a feature plugin, support for the features of TGMPA as is (but better) will be continued,&#8221; Folmer said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With the modular development, it won&#8217;t be as easy anymore to download &#8216;TGMPA&#8217; from GitHub, as you&#8217;d need to download all the different modules (or use composer / use git submodules),&#8221; she said. &#8220;I envision the <a href="http://wptavern.com/tgm-plugin-activation-team-releases-custom-generator" target="_blank">Custom TGMPA Generator</a> to be the way forward for downloading TGMPA as a complete package in that respect.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Can TGMPA Gain Enough Support from Core Developers to Become a Feature Plugin?</h3>\n<p>Folmer said that the WordPress core developers she has spoken with are divided on whether on whether its current approach makes it a good candidate for a feature plugin.</p>\n<p>During <a href="https://github.com/TGMPA/TGM-Plugin-Activation/issues/447" target="_blank">preliminary discussions on GitHub</a>, WordPress core committer <a href="http://pento.net/" target="_blank">Gary Pendergast</a> expressed reservations about requiring too much user interaction during the process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The primary goal of plugin dependencies should be that it&#8217;s invisible to the user,&#8221; Pendergast said. &#8220;If there&#8217;s ever a point where the user is asked to make a decision, then it&#8217;s not ready for core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a quick read through the TGMPA code,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s solving the problem it needed to solve (providing a drop-in library for themes and plugins), but I think we&#8217;d need to tie it much more tightly into core for it to be a feature plugin.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Folmer hopes to address user experience concerns with refinements to the plugin based on feedback from the survey, which will be open until the end of March.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So far, most responses have been from developers using TGMPA,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Even though the survey is quite technical, we would very much also like to hear from more end-users.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With the recent confusion over WordPress.org&#8217;s previously unwritten rule <a href="http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-plugin-directory-will-no-longer-accept-frameworks" target="_blank">banning framework plugins from the official directory</a>, the challenge of managing inter-plugin dependencies is under the spotlight again. The TGM Plugin Activation library isn&#8217;t the only possible solution to this problem, but it does have a motivated contributor base that is willing to take up the challenge of solving this problem via a feature plugin.

In a post tiled &#8220;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2016/03/01/please-do-not-submit-frameworks/" target="_blank">Please do not submit frameworks</a>,&#8221; Mika Epstein outlined the reason behind the rule:</p>\n<blockquote><p>At this time, we are not accepting frameworks as we don’t feel frameworks, boilerplates, and libraries are appropriate for the Plugins Directory. We require that plugins be useful in and of themselves (even if only being a portal to an external service). And while there are many benefits to frameworks and libraries, without plugin dependency support in core or the directory, it becomes another level of hassle for users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Until WordPress core adopts a way to support plugin dependencies, the plugin review team recommends that frameworks and libraries be packaged with each plugin in a way that doesn&#8217;t conflict with other plugins/frameworks/libraries.</p>\n<p>The issue was most recently addressed with the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/cmb2/" target="_blank">CMB2</a> plugin, which Epstein said was <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2016/02/25/re-thinking-tags-in-the-plugin-directory/#comment-42655" target="_blank">mistakenly approved months ago.</a> CMB2 is essentially a library that makes it easy for developers to build metaboxes, custom fields, and forms. It is exactly the kind of plugin that the previously unwritten rule is meant to block from being available in the official directory. Epstein further clarified the reasons why:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The issue is as follows: Having a framework as a plugin is a poor experience for the user. Not the developer. The user. The user understands “I have an add-on for WooCommerce, I probably need Woo.” They do not always understand “I have plugin Slider Joe. Why do I need Advanced Custom Fields?” In addition, by having a library as a plugin, the onus of version compatibility is now on the person least likely to understand it: the user.</p>\n<p>The plugin repository is not, currently, a library or framework repository. It’s not meant like the NPM package manager, or even Composer as a way to define what a plugin ‘needs’ in the same ways for a developer to build a project. The plugin repository is, plain and simple, meant for plugins that users will find useful. Plugins that add functionality to WordPress in a directly inter-actable way.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The confusion lies in the fact that this particular rule has been applied inconsistently for years and has many notable exceptions, including <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/redux-framework/" target="_blank">Redux Framework</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/cmb2/" target="_blank">CMB2</a>, and arguably plugins like <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/piklist/" target="_blank">Piklist</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/titan-framework/" target="_blank">Titan Framework</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/kirki/" target="_blank">Kirki</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/options-framework/" target="_blank">Options Framework</a>, and many more. These are the types of plugins that don&#8217;t really do anything out of the box but are meant for developers to use for building things.</p>\n<p>According to Epstein, a few of these plugins have been &#8220;grandfathered in&#8221; due to oversights in the plugin review process, but the rule stands for new submissions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;CMB2 and Redux Framework are grandfathered in,&#8221; she <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2016/02/25/re-thinking-tags-in-the-plugin-directory/#comment-42655" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;We don’t let any more in, since a lot of plugins include them inside AS plugins. It’s a mess. Also CMB2 shouldn’t have been approved, which is a different mess altogether. Frameworks are not supposed to be in the repo at this time. Period.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Another commenter on the most recent post, who recently had his <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-term-fields/" target="_blank">Advanced Term Fields</a> plugin approved, asked, <strong>&#8220;Are you saying the best way to handle this scenario is to include the parent framework in each child plugin, as opposed to alerting the user that &#8216;This plugin requires XXX plugin in order to function properly?''&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Epstein confirmed that this is in fact what the team is suggesting:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Currently, yes. That would have been the best way. Since your plugin is approved, though, it’s unfair of us to yank the rug out from under you. While you don’t have a great many users, we recognize when the gaff is us.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The plugin review team has a difficult job and is working with limited volunteer resources. However, the inconsistent application of unwritten rules has led to what appears to be an arbitrary set of guidelines. One thing that would make life easier for both reviewers and plugin developers is if WordPress core adopted a way to manage inter-plugin dependencies. <a href="http://tgmpluginactivation.com/" target="_blank">The TGM Plugin Activation</a> team is <a href="https://github.com/TGMPA/TGM-Plugin-Activation/issues/447" target="_blank">working on a proposal for a feature plugin</a>, which we&#8217;ll examine in depth in an upcoming post.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 02 Mar 2016 00:49:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"WPTavern: Poetica Acquired by Condé Nast, Open Source WordPress Plugin Will Be Discontinued";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51903";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:100:"http://wptavern.com/poetica-acquired-by-conde-nast-open-source-wordpress-plugin-will-be-discontinued";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3293:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/poetica.png" rel="attachment wp-att-51905"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/poetica.png?resize=1025%2C520" alt="poetica" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51905" /></a></p>\n<p>Poetica <a href="https://blog.poetica.com/2016/03/01/our-next-chapter/" target="_blank">announced</a> today that its team and technology have been acquired by Condé Nast. The technology provided realtime &#8220;Google-docs style collaboration&#8221; in the WordPress post editor as well as a non-WordPress editor available via the public <a href="https://poetica.com/" target="_blank">Poetica.com</a> service. As of June 1, 2016, the service will be shut down.</p>\n<p>The Poetica team will continue to develop the technology as part of <a href="http://learn.copilot.conde.io/" target="_blank">Copilot</a>, Condé Nast’s proprietary publishing platform.</p>\n<p>According to CTO and co-founder Blaine Cook, <a href="https://twitter.com/blaine/status/704738953321013253" target="_blank">development on the open source plugin will be discontinued</a>, as the plugin is dependent on the Poetica service. Those who have been using the plugin will have no choice but to find an alternative.</p>\n<p>WordPress isn&#8217;t well-equipped for content collaboration. In fact, thanks to its fancy <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Locking" target="_blank">post locking</a> feature, WordPress is streamlined to enable the opposite of a collaborative editorial workflow. It&#8217;s designed for one user to work on a post while locking all other users out.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/post-locking.png" rel="attachment wp-att-9350"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/post-locking.png?resize=715%2C231" alt="post-locking" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9350" /></a></p>\n<p>Additionally, after a post is published, no further collaboration can be made, as the only way to make edits is to push changes immediately to the live copy.</p>\n<p>Poetica was one of the few tools that provided a way for editorial teams to write together, allowing multiple WordPress users to view and edit content at the same time. The plugin tracked changes and allowed users to make suggested edits that could be accepted or rejected.</p>\n<p>Although Poetica provided a much-needed collaboration tool for WordPress, its founders said they were unable to create a profitable business model around the software:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Up until now, though, we’ve been a small five-person team. We’ve tackled the dual problems of creating a humane, intuitive, and collaborative way to interact with text, on any device and any content platform; and the parallel challenge of creating a viable business model. Unfortunately, these goals were often at odds with each-other, competing for our limited time and attention.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After Poetica.com is shut down, it will destroy any drafts and user data from the site, as Condé Nast has only acquired the software and not the user data. Users will soon be notified via email about how to download a full archive of their drafts ahead of the June 1st shutdown.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 01 Mar 2016 19:38:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"WPTavern: aXe: An Open Source JavaScript Library for Automating Accessibility Testing";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51876";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"http://wptavern.com/axe-an-open-source-javascript-library-for-automating-accessibility-testing";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4883:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/axe-logo.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-51880"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/axe-logo.jpg?resize=780%2C366" alt="axe-logo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51880" /></a></p>\n<p>In June 2015 <a href="http://www.deque.com/" target="_blank">Deque</a>, an accessibility consultancy, open sourced <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core" target="_blank">aXe</a>, its accessibility rules engine for automated web UI testing. aXe is a compact JavaScript library (~100 KB) that executes automated accessibility tests inside your testing framework or browser. Deque outlined a number of advantages that the aXe library has over previous approaches to automated testing of HTML-based user interfaces:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It works on all modern browsers</li>\n<li>It supports in-memory fixtures, static fixtures, integration tests and iframes of infinite depth</li>\n<li>It has zero false positives (bugs notwithstanding)</li>\n<li>It is open source</li>\n<li>It is actively supported by a major accessibility vendor</li>\n<li>It is designed to work with whatever tools, frameworks, libraries and environments you have today</li>\n<li>It is designed to be integrated into your existing functional/acceptance automated tests</li>\n<li>It automatically determines which rules to run based on the evaluation context</li>\n<li>It is highly configurable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>aXe integrates with Karma, QUnit, Jasmine, Mocha, PhantomJS, and many others &#8211; basically any testing framework that supports JavaScript execution.</p>\n<h3>aXe Extension Adds Accessibility Testing to Chrome Developer Tools</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not using automated testing tools in your projects, the Chrome developer tools extension is the easiest gateway to performing accessibility tests directly in the browser as you&#8217;re viewing or building a website or application.</p>\n<p>aXe is available as a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd" target="_blank">free extension from the Chrome web store</a>. (Alternatively, it&#8217;s also available as an <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/axe-devtools/?src=search&utm_campaign=aXe%20The%20Accessibility%20Engine&utm_content=aXe%20for%20Firefox&utm_medium=Hyperlink&utm_source=Website" target="_blank">add-on for Firefox</a>.) Once you click &#8220;Add to Chrome,&#8221; aXe will be available under its own tab in Chrome DevTools panel. It automatically ferrets out accessibility defects and offers details for each violation.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/axe-on-wordpressorg.png" rel="attachment wp-att-51879"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/axe-on-wordpressorg.png?resize=1025%2C583" alt="axe-on-wordpressorg" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51879" /></a></p>\n<p>The creators of aXe were invited to contribute the open source library to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/2015/draft-charter-3" target="_blank">W3C WAI Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group</a>, as the group works to develop a normative set of rules for evaluating <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank">WCAG 2.0</a> conformance.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re working on improving WordPress&#8217; accessibility, the aXe extension can even help perform some of the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/testing/how-to-test-for-accessibility/" target="_blank">tests recommended by the Accessibility team</a>. You can log issues by <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-bugs/" target="_blank">creating a ticket on WordPress Trac</a> or testing patches for existing tickets.</p>\n<p>In 2014 the Accessibility team <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2014/05/02/automated-accessibility-testing/" target="_blank">discussed adding automated accessibility testing to WordPress</a>, with Quail.js as one of the frontrunners. The team is just now <a href="http://wptavern.com/your-chance-to-give-feedback-on-wordpress-accessibility-coding-standards" target="_blank">adding accessibility code standards to the WordPress core handbook</a>. The next step would be firming up a list of requirements for an automated testing tool. aXe might be a new possibility to consider, as it is open source and focused on helping websites meet WCAG 2.0 requirements.</p>\n<p>Deque&#8217;s mission with aXe is to bring equality to the digital world. They are working to make automated accessibility testing more mainstream with professional web developers. If accessibility is a priority for your work, <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core" target="_blank">aXe</a> is a lightweight library you may want to consider for automated testing on own projects.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 01 Mar 2016 01:11:51 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"WPTavern: Stripe Payment Gateway for WooCommerce Is Now Available for Free";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51757";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"http://wptavern.com/stripe-payment-gateway-for-woocommerce-is-now-available-for-free";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2694:"<p>Last week WooCommerce announced on Twitter that its <a href="https://www.woothemes.com/products/stripe/" target="_blank">Stripe payment gateway</a> is now a free product.

As of March 16th, new Mandrill users will create their accounts through MailChimp and existing users will be required to merge their accounts with a MailChimp account where they will be charged <a href="http://blog.mandrill.com/important-changes-to-mandrill.html" target="_blank">$20+/mo</a> for transactional emails. The deadline for merging accounts is April 27th.</p>\n<p>MailChimp is choosing to focus on delivering &#8220;personalized transactional&#8221; emails that require more design. For those who want to continue delivering utility type emails, the company recommends <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses/" target="_blank">Amazon SES</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Transactional emails, like password reminders and the myriad email notifications you get after making changes to online accounts, are dead simple. Utilitarian providers like Amazon SES excel at this. Their innovation is mostly focused on increasing efficiency and reducing costs.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Many WordPress developers depend on Mandrill for sending wp_mail() emails in order to ensure delivery and take this load off the server. After MailChimp&#8217;s announcement, many are scrambling to find an alternative.</p>\n<p>Amazon SES allows users to send 62,000 messages per month to any recipient, as long as you call it from an Amazon EC2 instance. If you already have one set up, this is one of the best options.</p>\n<p><a href="https://hmn.md/" target="_blank">Human Made</a> created an open source <a href="https://github.com/humanmade/aws-ses-wp-mail" target="_blank">plugin</a> that makes it easy to change to Amazon SES.

The Austin WordPress Meetup Group will be <a href="http://www.meetup.com/austinwordpress/events/228432694/" target="_blank">hosting the hackathon on April 8th</a>, which will coincide with <a href="https://wooconf.com/" target="_blank">WooConf</a>.</p>\n<p>Participants will spend the day building new WordPress-powered websites for 10 local non-profit organizations. At the end of the day, the following charities will have a new (or revamped) online presence with free hosting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>North Austin Community Media (aka KXPE-LP)</li>\n<li>The Blood Center of Central Texas</li>\n<li>Refugee Services of Texas</li>\n<li>PelotonU</li>\n<li>Circle of Health International</li>\n<li>Black Fret</li>\n<li>AIDS Services of Austin</li>\n<li>Texas PACE Authority</li>\n<li>Day With Daddy</li>\n<li>Austin Kids First</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re looking for are 5-6 people to sign up for each build team and with 10 build teams that means we&#8217;re looking for 50-60 people to get involved and help to give back to the non-profits in the Austin area,&#8221; Lashbrooke said. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to note that the build teams are not just developers &#8211; we&#8217;re looking for project managers, social media managers, designers and content creators as well as developers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The hackathon will be held at the tail end of WooConf and Lashbrooke said he hopes to attract a few WooConf attendees.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to make a more direct push to get WooConf attendees to be a part of the event, but right now the sign-up form is open to absolutely anyone,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>As part of the WordPress Community team&#8217;s new initiative to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2016/01/25/full-day-events/" target="_blank">standardize certain specialized full day events</a>, the do_action charity hackathon is now fully backed by the WordPress Foundation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Foundation will be on hand to offer support (logistically and financially) where necessary, just like with regular meetup events,&#8221; Lashbrooke said. &#8220;I will also be putting together documentation on how we organize this kind of event, which will be published on WordPress.org so that other communities can replicate the event type in their area.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When looking for non-profits to include, Lashbrooke said they don&#8217;t only look for organizations without websites. They also look for those that need their online presence improved or otherwise entirely rebuilt.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That may mean their website works fine, but it doesn&#8217;t really cater to their needs (accepting donations, selling goods, encouraging volunteers, etc.), so then on the day we can refresh things for them and make it all work in the way that they need it to,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Last year the Cape Town participants helped create websites for the <a href="http://www.adultswithautism.org.za/" target="_blank">Academy for Adults with Autism</a>, <a href="http://www.carecareers.co.za/" target="_blank">Care Career Connection</a>, the <a href="http://www.psoriasis.org.za/" target="_blank">South African Psoriasis Association</a>, and several others.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It really does feel great &#8211; the non-profit representatives are there on the day as well, and seeing their reaction to the results of the hard work from their teams is always hugely satisfying,&#8221; Lashbrooke said. &#8220;Ultimately, what we&#8217;re doing is empowering non-profits to get on with the work that they do best without their online presence being a hinderance to their work.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you live in Austin or will be attending WooConf and want to be part of the hackathon, you can sign up via the <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/2hjEXfSH0q" target="_blank">volunteer form</a>.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 18:16:52 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"WPTavern: The WordPress Plugin Directory Is Getting a Makeover";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51789";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-plugin-directory-is-getting-a-makeover";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2720:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hammer-nails.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-51795"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hammer-nails.jpg?resize=960%2C419" alt="photo credit: Patryk Dziejma" class="size-full wp-image-51795" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/POQ7B631M3">Patryk Dziejma</a>\n<p>In February 2015, the <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-directory-launches-new-design" target="_blank">WordPress Theme Directory launched a new design</a>. Konstantin Obenland worked with Samuel “Otto” Wood and the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/" target="_blank">WordPress meta team</a> to update the design and move the directory off of bbPress. Today Obenland <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2016/02/25/plugin-directory-v3/" target="_blank">announced</a> that the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/" target="_blank">Plugin Directory</a> will be getting a similar treatment.</p>\n<p>Version 3 of the Plugin Directory will focus heavily on improving the search interface, including prioritizing translated plugins for international users. Another major goal of the redesign is to streamline the plugin submission and review process. The new directory will be powered by WordPress, instead of bbPress, which will make it easier for plugin developers and reviewers to manage plugins, tags/categories, and committers.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/plugin-directory-version-3/" target="_blank">project overview</a>, plugins will be saved in a custom post type, offering reviewers a more efficient workflow that makes use of post statuses with capability controlled permissions. This will also make it possible to run automated checks on plugins, which should reduce the number of <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2016/02/03/plugin-review-inconsistencies/#comment-42561" target="_blank">inconsistencies in the review process</a>.</p>\n<p>The meta team plans to hit milestones every two weeks in order to ship version 3 by June 26, 2016. Obenland is aiming for getting a minimal viable product off the ground by March 1st, which would includes the plugin CPT, readme.txt parsing, and a basic display on the frontend. A full overview of the project and the tickets that will need to be addressed is available on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/plugin-directory-version-3/" target="_blank">make.wordpress.org/meta P2</a>.

Tammie Lister conducted <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/flow/2016/02/20/site-logo-and-icon-user-testing/" target="_blank">two users tests</a>, which she posted on the make.wordpress.org/flow blog.</p>\n<p>The first user landed on Appearance > Header and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not really sure if this is the logo where I should be adding this.&#8221; She goes back to the admin, returns again to the header setting, and then finally lands on the customizer. She mistakenly added a site icon thinking it was the logo. Eventually, she found the correct setting and added the logo.</p>\n<p>The second tester first landed on the Tools menu and then navigated to Appearance, got lost in the theme browser, and then landed on Customize. She thought she was on the wrong screen and went back. She navigated to Settings, Users, and several other screens in the process of trying to find the right place to upload the logo. Eventually she found it with the explicit instructions included in the testing round for those who are having trouble.</p>\n<p>Both test users struggled to find this feature. Based on these tests, it does not appear that adding a site logo is very intuitive for users who are not working in WordPress every day. Watching the test users struggle through the admin in search of this setting is rather painful.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Discoverability of the feature isn&#8217;t great,&#8221; Lister <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33755#comment:77" target="_blank">reported</a> when summarizing the results of her testing. &#8220;Perhaps this is ok as a theme feature. Perhaps we need to ensure publicity of this feature and documentation. Once people find it and use it the actual process makes sense.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Two Jetpack support personnel joined the conversation to report that the site logo feature has been well tested while used in the plugin and that they receive very few questions about it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t recall a single case where a user was confused about how to use the Site Logo, nor a single instance where a user confused it with the Site Icon,&#8221; Kathryn Presner said.</p>\n<p>Several contributors involved in the conversation commented that the feature seemed rushed. Given that nearly every modern website has a logo, this feature is one that is likely to be widely used with theme support. Theme authors will be the ones to add support for a site logo and field questions about how to use it. Based on the user tests, however, a brand new WordPress user with a vanilla site running Twenty Sixteen may be in for a bit of a hunt when trying to upload a logo.</p>\n<p>Schroder pulled the trigger yesterday to include the feature in the upcoming release and it is now available in the first beta <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/02/wordpress-4-5-beta-1/" target="_blank">released last night</a>. If you want to help test, the easiest way is to use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/" target="_blank">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin and select “bleeding edge nightlies.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 18:11:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"WPTavern: Automattic Adds AMP Support to WordPress.com, Releases Plugin for Self-Hosted Sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51722";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"http://wptavern.com/automattic-adds-amp-support-to-wordpress-com-releases-plugin-for-self-hosted-sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6300:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/amp-wpcom-screenshots2.png" rel="attachment wp-att-51747"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/amp-wpcom-screenshots2.png?resize=1025%2C372" alt="amp-wpcom-screenshots2" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51747" /></a></p>\n<p>Today WordPress.com <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2016/02/24/amp-for-wordpress-dot-com/" target="_blank">announced</a> support for <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/" target="_blank">Accelerated Mobile Pages</a> (AMP), Google&#8217;s open source project to improve the experience of the mobile web for publishers. When visitors arrive to a WordPress.com site via a mobile search, posts will load faster than ever before.</p>\n<p>Each post is dynamically generated according to the AMP spec, with /amp/ added to the end of the URL for the mobile version. They&#8217;re also cached in Google&#8217;s cloud infrastructure to reduce loading time. The performance gains are staggering. In early tests, Pinterest&#8217;s engineering team found that <strong>&#8220;<a href="https://engineering.pinterest.com/blog/building-faster-mobile-web-experience-amp" target="_blank">AMP pages load four times faster and use eight times less data than traditional mobile-optimized pages</a>.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>What makes AMP pages load so quickly? Google has a <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/get_started/technical_overview.html" target="_blank">strict set of optimizations</a> that are employed to improve mobile loading:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow only asynchronous scripts</li>\n<li>Size all resources statically</li>\n<li>Don’t let extension mechanisms block rendering</li>\n<li>Keep all third-party JavaScript out of the critical path</li>\n<li>All CSS must be inline and size-bound</li>\n<li>Font triggering must be efficient</li>\n<li>Minimize style recalculations</li>\n<li>Only run GPU-accelerated animations</li>\n<li>Prioritize resource loading</li>\n<li>Load pages in an instant</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To see just how fast AMP is, check out the Google search demo at <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/10/introducing-accelerated-mobile-pages.html" target="_blank">g.co/amp</a>.</p>\n<p>Automattic also released a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/" target="_blank">plugin</a> that allows self-hosted WordPress users to take advantage of the mobile performance improvements offered by AMP. The plugin has been tested since October and is currently active on 8,000 installs. For most users, it&#8217;s as easy as installing the plugin and activating it. The default styles are fairly generic but developers can refer to the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/amp-wp/blob/master/readme.md" target="_blank">documentation on GitHub</a> to further customize AMP styles.</p>\n<p>The Jetpack team is working on getting its publishing-related modules ready for AMP compatibility. In order to take advantage of AMP performance increases, users have to compromise on JS-powered features like Sharing Buttons and Likes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s definitely something on our roadmap, and we’re working on the details and timeline at the moment,&#8221; Jetpack team lead Sam Hotchkiss told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>According to <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/02/diving-all-in-or-dipping-a-toe-how-publishers-are-approaching-googles-accelerated-mobile-pages-initiative/" target="_blank">NiemanLab&#8217;s survey of newsrooms</a>, publishers that are not running on WordPress are struggling to get on board with AMP, due to the fact that it requires developer resources to implement. This is especially difficult for those that impose JavaScript-based paywalls, as AMP heavily restricts JavaScript.</p>\n<p>AMP allows for paywalls, subscription content, and ads, but for many publishers these will have to be rebuilt to be distributed according to the AMP specifications. At this time, AMP <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/325878c6bde7a4bd40d67e8c81b9e599af1039d7/ads/integration-guide.md" target="_blank">does not support “interstitials,”</a> the pop-up ads that obscure content and annoy readers.</p>\n<p>Publishers can opt not to support AMP, but the kicker is that Google may show preference to results that are configured to deliver AMP-powerd posts, simply by virtue of the fact that it already factors page speed into results. The <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/10/introducing-accelerated-mobile-pages.html" target="_blank">AMP demo</a> shows a carousel of AMP-powered posts under Top Stories, but it&#8217;s not yet clear whether this will be the actual implementation.</p>\n<h3>AMP is a Big Win for the Open Web</h3>\n<p>Google is firing back at <a href="https://instantarticles.fb.com/" target="_blank">Facebook’s Instant Articles</a> with the official launch of AMP today. Facebook&#8217;s attempt to speed up mobile viewing is platform-specific and only available within its app. AMP, on the other hand, works anywhere online and is controlled and customized by the publisher.</p>\n<p>In October 2015, WordPress.com was one of the first publishers to partner with Google on this initiative to speed up the mobile web. Paul Maiorana, VP of Platform Services at Automattic, <a href="https://vip.wordpress.com/2015/10/07/mobile-web/" target="_blank">announced the company&#8217;s involvement in the project on the VIP blog</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We believe that open source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation. We strongly and actively support a free, open internet. We’re very happy to support an open source initiative like AMP, which brings publishers and technology companies together to make a better mobile experience for everyone.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The mobile web is currently a zombie wasteland of bloated, sluggish pages &#8211; many sites are unbearable to browse and users quickly abandon slow-loading pages. The AMP project helps publishers deliver a leaner version of posts. It makes mobile browsing faster for everyone, not just those using a few select apps. As such, it is a victory for the open web.</p>\n<p>For more background on the project with comments from WordPress.com&#8217;s Paul Maiorana, check out video below:</p>\n<div class="embed-wrap"></div>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 22:27:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"Matt: Ten Thousand Hours with Reid Hoffman";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46223";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"https://ma.tt/2016/02/ten-thousand-hours-with-reid-hoffman/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:287:"<p><a href="http://casnocha.com/">Ben Casnocha</a> is an interesting and innovative character in his own right, and <a href="http://casnocha.com/reid-hoffman-lessons">it&#8217;s worth reading his essay slash short book on the years he spent as the right hand man of Reid Hoffman</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 16:17:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"WPTavern: WordCamp Miami Wapuuno Cards Now Available on GitHub";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51699";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-miami-wapuuno-cards-now-available-on-github";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1942:"<p>One of the challenges of organizing a WordCamp is coming up with general swag for the event that will delight attendees, as opposed to filling swag bags with cheap plastic junk. Organizers are also tasked with arranging a gift for speakers. WordCamp Miami, which will be entering its ninth year running in 2017, is well known for creating fun collectibles for attendees and speakers. Last year the team gave <a href="https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/status/702185356330930176" target="_blank">“WordPress developer” cards</a> as speaker gifts.</p>\n<p>This year organizers created a deck of Wapuu Uno cards, dubbed &#8220;Wapuuno,&#8221; as a gift for speakers. Each card features a different wapuu, most of which were designed for past WordCamps in various locations around the world. Organizer David Bisset created the deck based on open source Wapuus that are publicly available.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wapuuno-cards.png" rel="attachment wp-att-51701"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wapuuno-cards.png?resize=1025%2C915" alt="wapuuno-cards" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51701" /></a></p>\n<p>I asked Bisset what he would recommend to other WordCamp organizers who are stumped about what to get speakers. &#8220;I don’t think speaker gifts need to be anything meaningful,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Miami does these out of fun, but organizers shouldn’t be pressured to do these things. If they are stumped, sometimes a gift is simply a nice coffee or trinket.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://github.com/dimensionmedia/Wapuuno" target="_blank">Wapuuno cards</a> are now available on GitHub for anyone to download and print. Bisset joked that WordCamp Miami organizers are looking into creating Candy Land style Wapuu cards in 2017 but is hoping that other WordCamp organizers will beat them to it.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 00:03:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"WPTavern: 10up Open Sources ElasticPress Plugin for WooCommerce";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51677";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://wptavern.com/10up-open-sources-elasticpress-plugin-for-woocommerce";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6465:"<p><a href="https://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/" target="_blank">WooCommerce</a> is currently the most popular way to add a store to WordPress.

Wappalyzer estimates a <a href="https://wappalyzer.com/categories/ecommerce" target="_blank">31% marketshare</a> in the e-commerce category and <a href="http://builtwith.com/ecommerce/" target="_blank">BuiltWith has WooCommerce at roughly 29%</a> among other shopping cart technologies.

The reason many stores are still built on Magento, an open source shopping cart with a more complicated store management interface, is because it was built to handle massive stores with thousands of products and complex searches. WooCommerce is rapidly becoming a more viable option for these types of stores, with continual <a href="https://www.woothemes.com/2016/01/woocommerce-25-dashing-dolphin/" target="_blank">performance improvements</a> and the new open source <a href="http://10up.com/blog/2016/elasticpress-woocommerce-plugin/" target="_blank">ElasticPress WooCommerce</a> extension from <a href="http://10up.com/" target="_blank">10up</a>.</p>\n<p>In 2014 the engineering team at 10up created <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/elasticpress/" target="_blank">ElasticPress</a> to improve WordPress search, allow for complex search filters, and allow for cross-blog search within multisite (a feature missing from existing ElasticSearch plugins at the time).</p>\n<p>Taylor Lovett, 10up&#8217;s Director of Web Engineering, said he was surprised by the amount of feedback they received on the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The plugin grew from just search to improving WordPress performance by routing slow queries through Elasticsearch,&#8221; Lovett said. &#8220;As such, we continued to iterate on the project, supporting as many WP_Query parameters as possible and making things as developer friendly as possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>During that time Lovett was traveling to WordCamps around the world talking about the power of ElasticPress. He met other developers who asked what it would take to support WooCommerce queries.</p>\n<p>&#8220;ElasticPress has a very powerful API that allows it to route almost all WordPress functionality through Elasticsearch instead of MySQL,&#8221; Lovett said. &#8220;However, in order to make the plugin really work for WooCommerce, we needed a &#8216;connector&#8217; of sorts. The connector mostly enables Elasticsearch integration in the admin, adds support for indexing ALL post statuses and public post types, and passes appropriate GET parameters to WP_Query in ElasticPress proper formats. ElasticPress tries to support all of WP_Query functionality but there are some holes that the connector needed to fill.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew that WooCommerce sites could suffer from performance problems given the complex product/order queries that they run,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As such, we built ElasticPress WooCommerce to solve those problems.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After testing the plugin locally on a store with about 10,000 products and 20,000 orders, 10up found that <strong>&#8220;ElasticPress WooCommerce can easily turn database queries that take 3-4 seconds into Elasticsearch queries that take 30 milliseconds.&#8221;</strong> According to Lovett, the tests included about 20 WooCommerce extensions and the database queries were timed using the Debug Bar, Debug Bar Extender, and Debug Bar ElasticPress.</p>\n<p>ElasticPress WooCommerce provides roughly a 100% data retrieval performance improvement when it comes to filtering products on both the frontend and in the admin. This helps stores render pages faster to capture potential customers while they&#8217;re in the buying mood.</p>\n<h3>Using ElasticPress WooCommerce for Performance Increases with Other Extensions</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/elasticpress-woocommerce.png" rel="attachment wp-att-51691"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/elasticpress-woocommerce.png?resize=1025%2C439" alt="elasticpress-woocommerce" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51691" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/elasticpress-woocommerce/" target="_blank">ElasticPress WooCommerce</a> requires ElasticPress 1.8+ and PHP 5.2.4+. Once those are in place, it is relatively plug-and-play. Lovett said that the only caveat is that it is not guaranteed to support the hundreds of WooCommerce extensions completely. If an extension uses WP_Query in a way that&#8217;s compatible with ElasticPress then it should automatically take advantage of the performance increases.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We try to support as much extension functionality as we can but there is just too much to tackle,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The way those extensions use WP_Query varies. We can’t predict how every extension interacts with WP_Query and don’t have time to test every single one.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some extensions have no bearing on ElasticPress WooCommerce,&#8221; Lovett said. &#8220;For example, a different payment gateway. Extensions that involve showing/filtering products and orders should test their extensions with the plugin and refer to the ElasticPress documentation to make sure they are only using supported WP_Query parameters.&#8221;</p>\n<p>10up is looking for more developers to test and collaborate on the project, which is hosted on both <a href="https://github.com/10up/elasticpress-woocommerce" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/elasticpress-woocommerce/" target="_blank">WordPress.org</a>. The company plans to improve the plugin based on experience with enterprise WooCommerce customers. If you are looking to scale WooCommerce or are currently managing a sluggish store, ElasticPress WooCommerce is one option that you may want to test.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 20:51:58 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"WPTavern: WordPress Tops Alignable’s Small Business Trust Index";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51635";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-tops-alignables-small-business-trust-index";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4128:"<p>In a <a href="https://www.alignable.com/small-business-insights/introducing-alignables-smb-trust-index" target="_blank">SMB trust index survey</a> conducted by Alignable in the fourth quarter of 2015, WordPress ranked as the most trusted of 25 nationally recognized brands used by small business owners. The results were ranked using the (<a href="http://www.netpromotersystem.com/about/measuring-your-net-promoter-score.aspx" target="_blank">Net Promoter System</a>), a trademarked customer loyalty metric that measures promoters against detractors to produce a net trustworthiness score.</p>\n<p>The survey, which was <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/techflash/2016/02/alignable-survey-smb-trust-q4-2015-yelp-wordpress.html" target="_blank">originally reported by the San Francisco Business Times</a>, was roundly disregarded in the WordPress community due to the misuse of the word &#8216;company&#8217; in the Times&#8217; writeup:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For small business owners, WordPress is a well-trusted company, Yelp is a brand in trouble, and Facebook is on a downward path.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, the wording on the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/alignable/content/Alignable-SMB-Trust-Index-Q4-2015.pdf" target="_blank">ranking graphic</a> seemed to trivialize the results: <em>&#8220;WordPress proves &#8216;free&#8217; doesn&#8217;t always mean &#8216;junk.''&#8221;</em></p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wordpress-nps-results.png" rel="attachment wp-att-51664"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wordpress-nps-results.png?resize=1025%2C729" alt="wordpress-nps-results" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51664" /></a></p>\n<p>Despite the odd presentation, the results are worth examining, as Alignable surveyed more than 6,000 small business owners across 7,000 communities in North America. WordPress received an NPS of 73, significantly higher than other brands known for website creation: Shopify (29), Godaddy (26), Squarespace (11), Wix (-7), Weebly (-13), and Web.com (-61).</p>\n<p>The footnote on the report explains the relative position changes which are shown on the rankings graphic for brands that were included in the previous quarter&#8217;s survey:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Data represents running, cumulative report of SMB sentiment of vendors and providers from more than 6,000 ratings. Relative position changes from this quarter to the prior quarter were generated from the 25% net new ratings added to the database in the quarter. Alignable members rated these brands on a sliding scale from 0-10. NPS values calculated by subtracting percentage of detractors (brands rated 0-6) from percentage of promoters (brands rated 9-10).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Godaddy fell one point in positioning and Wix and Weebly fell 4 and 8 points respectively. WordPress is new to Alignable&#8217;s SMB index and should have relative position notes included in next quarter&#8217;s survey.</p>\n<p>Although the footnote specifies that the index rates brands, the 25 that are included are clearly companies and products. Any conclusions drawn from rating the general WordPress brand would be somewhat nebulous, given that it&#8217;s not clear if business owners are rating their experiences with the WordPress.com service or the self-hosted software. With the introduction of <a href="http://wptavern.com/early-reviews-show-applications-like-calypso-are-the-future-of-wordpress" target="_blank">Calypso</a>, the gap between the two publishing experiences continues to grow.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, most of the brands included are also representative of several different products. The scores are more of a general indication of the trustworthiness of the brand name, although creators of the Net Promoter System claim that a high NPS can point toward long-term profitable growth. If you&#8217;re in the business of building websites or applications for clients, it&#8217;s good to know that the trustworthiness of the WordPress brand is ranking high among industry competitors.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 19:53:19 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:112:"WPTavern: Varying Vagrant Vagrants 1.3.0 Released with Support for MailCatcher and More Virtualization Providers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51643";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:122:"http://wptavern.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants-1-3-0-released-with-support-for-mailcatcher-and-more-virtualization-providers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2774:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/vvv.png" rel="attachment wp-att-51659"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/vvv.png?resize=1025%2C473" alt="vvv" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51659" /></a></p>\n<p>Over the weekend, Jeremy Felt released <a href="https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/2016/02/21/varying-vagrant-vagrants-1-3-0/" target="_blank">Varying Vagrant Vagrants 1.3.0</a>.

It&#8217;s available in the browser at vvv.dev:1080 in case you need to troubleshoot WordPress core and/or plugins.</p>\n<p>Felt, the project&#8217;s current maintainer, said that he is aiming to push out more incremental releases every three months and hopes to get more developers using the <code>develop</code> branch on GitHub.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A tough thing about marking version numbers on a project like VVV is that all of the various versions of included packages change frequently,&#8221; Felt said. &#8220;We need to do a better job of making it easier to maintain existing packages.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Felt is currently <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/issues/583" target="_blank">soliciting feedback on changing the TLD for test sites</a> in the next version, as Google is attempting to <a href="https://gtldresult.icann.org/application-result/applicationstatus/applicationdetails/1339" target="_blank">gain control of the .dev TLD</a>. If the company were to open it up for public registration, it could cause confusion with test sites. After a brief discussion with VVV users, Felt has narrowed the considerations to .localhost, .test, and .local.</p>\n<p>In addition to a new TLD for test sites, Felt hopes to update packages on <code>vagrant provision</code> in a future release, which should help keep PHP, Nginx, and MySQL updated. He also wants to make it easy to remove the default configurations for WordPress local, trunk, and dev environments that are offered with VVV out of the box.</p>\n<p>For more details on the 23 features and bug fixes in 1.3.0, check out the official <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/1.3.0/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 16:02:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"Matt: New Yorker on Zen Master Poet";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46218";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:52:"https://ma.tt/2016/02/new-yorker-on-zen-master-poet/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:171:"<p>It&#8217;s never a bad time to <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/10/20/zen-master">read and learn about the life, work, and poetry of Gary Snyder</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 15:50:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:26:"Matt: Jazzy Claire de Lune";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46164";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"https://ma.tt/2016/02/jazzy-claire-de-lune/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:939:"<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>I love this version from <a href="http://www.kamasiwashington.com/">Kamasi Washington</a> of Claude Debussy&#8217;s Clair de Lune, or &#8220;light of the moon.&#8221;

And HTTPS is required for HTTP/2, which is making a big splash as well, quickly outpacing SPDY.

It is the world&#8217;s largest virtual conference ever assembled, with 64,000 developers registered for last year&#8217;s event. hack.summit() will feature an impressive array of programming language creators and open source contributors and all ticket sales/donations go to support programming non-profits such as Code.org, Code for America, CoderDojo, and Girls Who Code.</p>\n<p>The event focuses on three primary objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To educate programmers of all languages and skill sets</li>\n<li>To raise money for coding nonprofits</li>\n<li>To encourage mentorship among software developers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In lieu of traditional ticket sales, hack.summit() attendees are asked to donate to one of the selected coding non-profits. Those who are not financially able to donate can get a free ticket by sharing the event on Twitter or Facebook. Attendees are provided with a unique ticket number after registering, which includes access to the live conference.</p>\n<p>The event heavily promotes mentoring by asking attendees to sign a <a href="https://hackpledge.org/" target="_blank">hack pledge</a> to help mentor the next generation of developers with a minimum of one hour of coding help. The hack pledge video below features stories from programmers who have struggled to master software craftsmanship and those who benefited greatly from mentors:</p>\n<div class="embed-wrap"></div>\n<p>hack.summit() will also host the largest <a href="https://www.koding.com/Hackathon" target="_blank">virtual hackathon</a> in the world. Participants will create a web app using any publicly available API that falls within three general categeries: data visualization, productivity, or gaming. Last year&#8217;s event drew 60,000 coders from more than 900 cities. Participants will compete to win from a $150,000 prize pool.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for an interesting non-WordPress event to attend this year, <a href="https://hacksummit.org/" target="_blank">hack.summit()</a> is one of the most accessible with high quality speakers that will expand your technical horizons.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 19 Feb 2016 20:21:26 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"Matt: WordPress NPS";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46156";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"https://ma.tt/2016/02/wordpress-nps/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:753:"<blockquote><p>For small business owners, WordPress is a well-trusted company, Yelp is a brand in trouble, and Facebook is on a downward path.

Last year there were 89 WordCamps with 21,000 attendees across 34 countries. A surprising 60% of the 601 WordCamp organizers were doing it for the first time. More people are getting involved in hosting WordPress events but there are many areas of the world that have yet to experience one.</p>\n<p>The WordPress community team, which provides support and guidance for WordCamps, will be experimenting with bringing events to new locations in 2016. Ordinarily, WordCamps spring up organically from local WordPress communities with active meetups. The new <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/02/experiment-wordcamp-incubator/" target="_blank">WordPress incubator program</a> will bring a WordCamp to three new cities where meetups are not necessarily as well established.</p>\n<p>Jen Mylo outlined the goal of the program in a recent <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/02/experiment-wordcamp-incubator/" target="_blank">post</a> on the WordPress news blog:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The intention of the incubator program is to help spread WordPress to underserved areas through providing more significant organizing support for a first event. In practical terms, this experiment means we’ll be choosing three cities in 2016 where there is not an active WordPress community — but where it seems like there is a lot of potential and where there are some people excited to become organizers — and will help to organize their first WordCamp.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The new WordCamps will be designed as one-day, one-track events that connect the local community and inspire them to establish an ongoing presence.

Dalman started the organization to help veterans find employment opportunities in WordPress and other web technologies. He plans to continue with a modified version of the Happy Joe mission set up as a for-profit venture.</p>\n<p>After operating for the past two years as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization, Dalman no longer has the desire to continue raising funds. Happy Joe pulled in $80,000 in 2015 through corporate sponsorships and private donations, but Dalman started 2016 with no funds to carry through.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The reality is we can’t continue on a zero budget and I can’t continue to work for free,&#8221; he said. &#8220;While it would be simple to say dedicate more time to asking companies and people for funding, it’s not in my heart to do so anymore. I believe in being self-sufficient and not a burden on others.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lack of funding is the primary reason the organization is shutting down, but Dalman also struggled with the perception of non-profits. With organizations like the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/28/us/wounded-warrior-project-spends-lavishly-on-itself-ex-employees-say.html?_r=0" target="_blank">Wounded Warrior Foundation receiving negative press for excessive spending</a>, Dalman said the growing skepticism of non-profits made his job more challenging.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There’s no doubt that accountability and transparency is critical and Happy Joe has strived to excel in this. But the wrong assumptions about what a non-profit can do and the skepticism and lack of trust also complicates the mission for teams operating in the non-profit space for the future. Battling these challenges keeps us from doing the work that truly matters.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dalman&#8217;s non-profit post-mortem also cites negative stereotypes about veterans, expectations of rewards or kickbacks for donations, and his own leadership as contributing factors to his decision to shut the organization down.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We will now operate as a for-profit venture and will shift our focus from web tech training to building a talent marketplace where veterans can get freelance work and be mentored in growing a business,&#8221; Dalman said.</p>\n<p>The new for-profit venture will drop some of the programs that Happy Joe offered previously but will continue to assist veterans in seeking employment and developing entrepreneurial skills.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 22:29:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"WPTavern: GitHub Introduces Issue and Pull Request Templates";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51565";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"http://wptavern.com/github-introduces-issue-and-pull-request-templates";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2547:"<p>Last week GitHub <a href="http://wptavern.com/github-responds-to-letter-from-open-source-project-maintainers" target="_blank">responded to a letter from open source project maintainers</a> with apologies for the lack of communication and lack of attention to feedback regarding issue management.

Project maintainers can use this template to ensure that crucial information, such as expected behavior, reproduction steps, and version tested, is included in the bug report. This is the kind of information that saves time for everyone involved in testing and improving the software.</p>\n<p>Pull request templates follow the same file-naming pattern (PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). These new templates can be added to either the root directory of the repository or the new .github/ directory. GitHub recommends placing CONTRIBUTING.md, ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md, and PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md files in the .github/ folder to reduce clutter in the root directory.</p>\n<p>GitHub&#8217;s new issue and pull request templates are a positive step toward reaffirming the company&#8217;s commitment to supporting open source projects.

If properly exploited, it could allow registered users, regardless of role, on your WordPress installation to perform a subset of actions within the Divi Builder, including the ability to manipulate posts.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>In addition to the Divi Builder, the vulnerability was also found in the Divi, Extra, and Divi 2.3 (legacy) themes and the Boom and Monarch plugins. It was privately disclosed and promptly patched by Elegant Themes with the help of a third-party security vendor. No known exploit attempts have been made.</p>\n<p>Updating the themes and plugins will fix the vulnerability but the patches were created only for the most recent versions. Legacy theme customers now have an upgrade path, including a version that doesn&#8217;t add new functionality. Customers who are not ready to update are advised to turn registration off on their sites, as untrusted users increases the possibility of privilege escalation. Elegant Themes also recommends installing its Security Patcher plugin and utilizing the CloudProxy WAF from Sucuri, which has virtually patched the vulnerability.</p>\n<p>As of 2015, Elegant Themes has more than 300,000 customers. Given the severity of the vulnerability, the company is also making the updates available for free to all expired accounts via its updater plugin. Customers who have forgotten their login credentials can contact Elegant Themes to have the latest versions of the themes and plugins sent to them.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 16:02:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"WPTavern: WP Pusher 2.1.0 Offers Tighter Integration with GitHub and Bitbucket";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51525";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"http://wptavern.com/wp-pusher-2-1-0-offers-tighter-integration-with-github-and-bitbucket";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4285:"<p>WP Pusher is on a relentless mission to make it effortless for WordPress developers to connect their plugin and theme repositories hosted on GitHub and Bitbucket. <a href="http://blog.wppusher.com/wp-pusher-2-1-0-has-landed/" target="_blank">Version 2.1.0</a> of the plugin eliminates the requirement to manually create a token with GitHub and introduces 1-click authentication via OAuth.

We don’t store anything. Your GitHub and Bitbucket tokens are not stored on our servers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After determining that OAuth would be one of the safest ways to manage this, Suhm reached out to GitHub and they suggested the approach of building a small service to perform authentication. He&#8217;s now exploring different ways he can make both the code and service available to other developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The whole infrastructure is built using the Laravel PHP framework and their excellent <a href="https://github.com/laravel/socialite" target="_blank">Socialite</a> package,&#8221; Suhm said. &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking about either open sourcing the service (when it&#8217;s been online for a bit) or writing an in-depth tutorial on how to set up a similar thing. I also thought about offering the service to other WordPress plugin authors, since OAuth can be used for so many things, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and even WordPress.com authentication.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Version 2.1.0 also adds a new Push-to-Deploy checkbox, which removes the requirement of manually setting up a webhook on GitHub or Bitbucket. WP Pusher now sets up the webhook automatically in the background.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Setting up automatic updates is something I&#8217;ve gotten many support requests about,&#8221; Suhm said. &#8220;Now, all you have to do is check a checkbox and your plugin or theme will be updated every time you push a change to GitHub.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now that the plugin uses OAuth, it can be even more tightly integrated with GitHub and Bitbucket in future updates.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The next big thing I want to work on, which is now possible, is to allow users to select and install a plugin or theme directly from GitHub &#8211; with just one click,&#8221; Suhm said.</p>\n<p>The improvements offered in WP Pusher 2.1.0 make it even easier for new users to start deploying WordPress themes and plugins directly from GitHub without all the hassle of manually creating tokens and setting up webhooks. However, users still need a basic knowledge of Git in order to use the product. Suhm continues to offer <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-pusher-launches-free-git-crash-course-for-wordpress-developers" target="_blank">free Git education for WordPress developers</a> in hopes of expanding his customer base.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordPress devs are definitely starting to get interested in Git, as I had more than 1,000 developers sign up to my video course,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>WP Pusher is free to use for open source code hosted in public repositories. Since Suhm doesn&#8217;t track his users, he doesn&#8217;t have exact numbers for how many sites are using the plugin. Although he would not disclose how many licenses he has sold, he estimates that approximately 1,000 developers have installed WP Pusher. Suhm&#8217;s customers range from small freelancers to agencies to large universities.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 21:52:56 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"WPTavern: TGM Plugin Activation Team Releases Custom Generator";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51498";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"http://wptavern.com/tgm-plugin-activation-team-releases-custom-generator";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3104:"<p>The development team behind TGM Plugin Activation <a href="http://tgmpluginactivation.com/2016/02/12/custom-tgmpa-generator/" target="_blank">released its new generator</a> last week. The popular tool is a PHP library that allows WordPress developers to require or recommend plugins for a theme or plugin. It essentially helps walk WordPress users through installation and activation of plugin dependencies in the admin.</p>\n<p>Bundling a bunch of plugin-type functionality into a theme is generally discouraged, but authors still need a way to recommend additional extensions. The <a href="https://github.com/TGMPA/TGM-Plugin-Activation" target="_blank">TGMPA</a> library is a solution to this problem and is recommended by Themeforest, CodeCanyon, and the WordPress.org Theme Review Team as an alternative to bundling.</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://tgmpluginactivation.com/download/" target="_blank">new generator</a> addresses an issue that theme authors were running up against while using TGMPA and publishing themes to WordPress.org. The Theme Check plugin would often spit out feedback preventing the theme from passing all the checks: <em>“You are only allowed to use add_theme_page(), please remove the call to add_submenu_page(),” or “You are only supposed to use one text-domain.”</em></p>\n<p>According to TGMPA contributor Juliette Reinders Folmer&#8217;s, authors reported having performed a search-and-replace that resulted in fatal errors because it would often change some strings that should not have been changed. This process repeated anytime TGMPA needed to be updated.</p>\n<p>The Custom TGMPA generator asks the author to input the type of extension where TGMPA is being used, as well as the avenue of distribution. Authors then add the text domain, function prefix, and the theme/plugin name. The generator automatically outputs a download of the latest stable version of TGMPA with the customized strings already in place.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tgmpa-custom-generator.png" rel="attachment wp-att-51507"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tgmpa-custom-generator.png?resize=1025%2C322" alt="tgmpa-custom-generator" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51507" /></a></p>\n<p>The Custom TGMPA generator is the result of a <a href="https://github.com/TGMPA/TGM-Plugin-Activation/pull/460" target="_blank">discussion</a> with WordPress.org representatives regarding issues that continually pop up during theme reviews.

They were frustrated by a lack of communication from GitHub and a lack of features for managing issues. More than 1700 maintainers of open source projects, including several projects related to WordPress, have <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oGsg02jS-PnlIMJ3OlWIOEmhtG-udTwuDz_vsQPBHKs/edit#gid=290603204" target="_blank">signed</a> the letter so far.</p>\n<p>GitLab, a competing code hosting service, <a href="http://wptavern.com/gitlab-courts-open-source-project-maintainers-with-response-to-dear-github-letter" target="_blank">responded to the letter</a> almost immediately with a new GitLab issue that outlined every concern mentioned in the original &#8220;Dear GitHub&#8221; letter. The new initiative is focused on &#8220;<a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/8938" target="_blank">making GitLab the best place for big open source projects</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GitHub, on the other hand, took roughly a month to reply. The company&#8217;s staff forked the letter and drafted <a href="https://github.com/bkeepers/dear-github/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">a reply</a> containing an apology and a promise to address their concerns:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dear Open Source Maintainers,</p>\n<p>We hear you and we&#8217;re sorry. We&#8217;ve been slow to respond to your letter and slow to respond to your frustrations.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re working hard to fix this. Over the next few weeks we&#8217;ll begin releasing a number of improvements to Issues, many of which will address the specific concerns raised in the letter. But we&#8217;re not going to stop there. We&#8217;ll continue to focus on Issues moving forward by adding new features, responding to feedback, and iterating on the core experience. We&#8217;ve also got a few surprises in store.</p>\n<p>Issues haven&#8217;t gotten much attention from GitHub these past few years and that was a mistake, but we&#8217;ve never stopped thinking about or caring about you and your communities. However, we know we haven&#8217;t communicated that. So in addition to improving Issues, we&#8217;re also going to kick off a few initiatives that will help give you more insight into what&#8217;s on our radar. We want to make sharing feedback with GitHub less of a black box experience and we want to hear your ideas and concerns regularly.</p></blockquote>\n<p>GitHub closed the letter saying that the company would be in touch next week. Although no concrete changes have been announced, GitHub&#8217;s reply indicates that the company will be improving its communication and features to better serve open source projects and their communities. Hopefully this public exchange is a turning point for code hosting and collaboration services to prioritize features that open source project maintainers need.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 22:46:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"WPTavern: Customizer Responsive Preview and Selective Refresh to be Merged Into WordPress 4.5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51451";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:103:"http://wptavern.com/customizer-responsive-preview-and-selective-refresh-to-be-merged-into-wordpress-4-5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3307:"<p>Last week the feature plugin decision deadline closed and WordPress core contributors approved Responsive Preview and Selective Refresh for merge.

Weston Ruter <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-partial-refresh/issues/22#issuecomment-182594185" target="_blank">recommended</a> that they require opt-in for widget selective refresh in 4.5 and warn developers that it will be set to default in the next release.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31195" target="_blank">new responsive preview feature</a> is part of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-ui-experiments/" target="_blank">Customizer UI Experiments</a> plugin.

First, it checks the status of a site, then backs everything up, and then runs all updates via WP-CLI. The script then checks the site to see if everything is good. If anything breaks, it restores the backup. Hansen said that they execute it on a cron job so that it doesn&#8217;t require a person to run it. The company uses the script to continually update WordPress sites without customers having to initiate updates.</p>\n<p>Bluehost used the script to successfully update 99% of the WordPress sites on its platform. After the first major update, fewer than 0.007% of customers reported issues and WordPress-related technical support requests have been reduced by 18%.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our support requests are down partly because we are not getting as many hacked sites on super old versions of WordPress,&#8221; Hansen told the Tavern. &#8220;Things break less often. Plugin and theme incompatibilities have been reduced.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Initially we were considering upgrading core, then plugins, then themes but we realized that doing them all at once was the most successful route,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Bluehost&#8217;s initiative was a huge vote of confidence for WordPress updates, as they have now been battle tested by the host all the way back to very old versions. When 4.3 was released, Bluehost was able to do 2.6 million core updates, along with plugins and themes.</p>\n<p>Yesterday the company open sourced the WP Tools update script under the GPL license. It&#8217;s now <a href="https://github.com/bluehost/wp-tools" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a> for any person or hosting company to use or modify. The script received its <a href="https://github.com/bluehost/wp-tools/pull/1" target="_blank">first pull request</a> in less than 24 hours. With contribution from other hosts working to make the internet more secure, WP Tools has the potential to become even more reliable for ongoing WordPress updates.</p>\n<p>Check out the video below to see the part of the State of the Word where Matt Mullenweg tells Bluehost&#8217;s story of updating outdated WordPress sites:</p>\n<div class="embed-wrap"></div>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 18:54:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Matt: WordCamp US 2017 + 2018";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46137";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"https://ma.tt/2016/02/wordcamp-us-2017-2018/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:609:"<p>When we chose Philadelphia to host the first ever WordCamp US, it was actually for two years, <a href="https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/">they&#8217;ll be hosting again this year December 2-4</a>.

BuddyPress lead developer Paul Gibbs spearheaded this initiative and summarized the outcome when introducing the new API on his blog:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In a nutshell, we moved emails into a custom post type (BuddyPress’ first!) with a supporting taxonomy (BuddyPress’ second!), devised a HTML email template with Customizer integration, and wrote a new API to manage how we represent emails internally and how we send them (goodbye, <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_mail/" target="_blank">wp_mail</a>!).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gibbs has been writing plugins for the platform for the past seven years. He started with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/welcome-pack/" target="_blank">Welcome Pack</a>, a plugin that allowed community admins to customize welcome emails to enhance the new user experience. His experience building and maintaining the now defunct Welcome Pack led him to work on improving BuddyPress&#8217; core email handling.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With retrospect, adding customizable emails to Welcome Pack is what killed my interest in that plugin,&#8221; Gibbs said. &#8220;It was such a lengthy, painful slog to get the customization working and nicely implemented (I picked the wrong approach), that when it was finally done, so was I!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gibbs&#8217; work on this ticket makes emails in BuddyPress 2.5 much easier to edit than they ever were in his Welcome Pack plugin. The new Emails custom post type allows administrators to edit the content of the plugin&#8217;s 16 default emails directly in the admin. The email template can also be edited in the customizer at <strong>Appearance >> Emails</strong> with controls to change the header, body, and footer background colors, and text size/colors.</p>\n<p>The new email capabilities allow BuddyPress community managers to personalize their sites&#8217; communication without having a lot of technical knowledge. It&#8217;s a significant improvement over the generic stock emails previously sent by the plugin.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/roadmap" target="_blank">project roadmap</a>, the 2.5 milestone is now 96% complete and the official release is expected in three weeks.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 11 Feb 2016 15:28:40 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"Matt: Lent This Year: Buying Things";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46113";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"https://ma.tt/2016/02/lent-this-year-buying-things/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1781:"<p>Today is Ash Wednesday and the start of Lent, when typically Catholics give something up, or try to form a new habit, for about six weeks.

It&#8217;s a valuable service that keeps things moving along in tickets and helps patches make their way into core.</p>\n<p>The most challenging part of testing patches is getting your testing environment set up properly. The WordPress core handbook has <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/patch/" target="_blank">instructions for using Grunt to test patches</a>, but they&#8217;re not easy to follow if you happen to be a more visual learner.</p>\n<p>Yesterday Ryan Boren published a tutorial for <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/flow/2016/02/08/testing-patches-with-vvv-on-mac-os/" target="_blank">testing patches with VVV on Mac OS</a>, complete with screenshots at every step. The bulk of the instructions cover establishing a test environment with <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV" target="_blank">VVV</a>, which requires you to install Vagrant, install Virtualbox, initialize Vagrant, install Git, and finally install VVV. Applying a patch and reverting it after testing is probably the easiest part of the entire process.</p>\n<p>Boren&#8217;s tutorial is one of the clearest and easiest to follow, because it helps you visualize what success looks like at every step. If you want to add mobile testing into the mix while testing patches, check out his <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/03/16/mobile-patch-testing-with-vvv-and-xip-io/" target="_blank">post</a> on using VVV and <a href="http://xip.io/" target="_blank">xip.io</a>. Boren explained how he goes through tickets with patches that change UI and adds mobile and desktop screenshots of his testing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These screenshots hasten UI feedback and usually reveal visual glitches on mobile that are then patched up, making our mobile experience that little bit better,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Until that blue sky someday when I can apply patches to a patch server with a tap, I’ve found VVV and xip.io to be the easiest way to do localhost testing of patches from mobile devices.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The process of setting up a test environment is the most time-consuming aspect of testing patches, but once you have it in place, it&#8217;s easy to apply them. Have you found an easier way to test patches with support for mobile devices? Let us know in the comments.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 12:30:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"WPTavern: Automattic Launches Components with 5 New Starter Themes Based on Underscores";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51347";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"http://wptavern.com/automattic-launches-components-with-5-new-starter-themes-based-on-underscores";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3366:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/components.png" rel="attachment wp-att-51349"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/components.png?resize=1025%2C429" alt="components" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51349" /></a></p>\n<p>Automattic&#8217;s team of theme developers <a href="http://themeshaper.com/2016/02/09/introducing-components/" target="_blank">announced the release of Components</a> today along with a suite of themes that extend the popular <a href="http://underscores.me/" target="_blank">Underscores</a> starter theme for specific use cases. These include a classic blog, modern blog, portfolio, magazine, and business theme. The new <a href="http://components.underscores.me/" target="_blank">Components</a> website lets theme authors download a theme that includes reusable components tailored to each theme type.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/components-portfolio.png" rel="attachment wp-att-51354"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/components-portfolio.png?resize=1025%2C625" alt="components-portfolio" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51354" /></a></p>\n<p>Each theme includes general layout structures and templates to support the specific type of theme. For example, when you select the &#8216;Portfolio&#8217; starter theme, your download will include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A portfolio post type, courtesy of Jetpack, added to all the necessary files</li>\n<li>A grid portfolio view</li>\n<li>A single column blog template</li>\n<li>A sliding panel for navigation, social menu, and also widgets</li>\n<li>A large featured image with full-width script</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s not much to see once the theme is installed, because it&#8217;s just a starting point designed to save time when building layouts and templates. Automattic&#8217;s theme team used its collective knowledge of developing hundreds of themes in order to create these five starter themes with the bare basics required for presenting content via these five major theme categories.</p>\n<p>Components was inspired by the community behind Underscores, according to Automattic theme wrangler David Kennedy. Developers using the starter theme often offered contributions that were beyond the scope of a simple starter theme.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While maintaining and improving Underscores, we always see great pull requests from the community that we turn away because the contributions end up being too specific for a normal starter theme,&#8221; Kennedy said. &#8220;Many of those additions would have been perfect in most themes. Now, some of them have a home in a project that zeroes in on a certain kind of user with each theme it builds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The project&#8217;s goal is to provide a &#8220;more modular, pattern-based approach to theme development.&#8221; Even if you&#8217;re not building with Underscores, many of the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/theme-components/tree/master/components" target="_blank">theme components</a> included in this project can be easily reused elsewhere as theme building blocks. The components library is open source and <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/theme-components" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a> for anyone to fork.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 05:19:14 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:10:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Tue, 08 Mar 2016 18:18:50 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"197599";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Tue, 08 Mar 2016 18:00:12 GMT";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 250";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130910223210";}', 'no');

What works and what doesn’t is often a mystery – and different for every one of us. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try a strange productivity trick every now and then. And it definitely doesn’t mean you should resist your own weird <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/new-research-on-what-really-works-for-improving-productivity.html" target="_blank">productivity tricks</a>. So long as you aren’t harming anyone, and it actually works, have at it.</p>\n<p>Just to get your creative productivity ideas flowing, we’ve rounded up some of the weirdest personal time management tricks around. I cannot vouch for how effective some of these are. I can’t even vouch for how safe some of them are. But according to their champions, they work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hire a few stagehands &#8211; or an accountability partner</h2>\n<p>This one’s for you procrastinators. Apparently, the opera composer Rossini (think Bugs Bunny music) had an awful time with procrastination. Really awful. Like the opera house is rented. They’ve sold tickets for a show that opens tomorrow. But the opera hasn’t yet… been… um&#8230; written.</p>\n<p>The opera house manager, fearing disaster, <a href="https://rivkastein.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/rossini-and-the-art-of-procrastination/" target="_blank">upped the ante</a>. He locked Rossini and four stagehands together in a room on a high floor. The stagehands were to take each completed page of the opera and throw it out the window, where copyists waited below to transcribe it. If Rossini didn’t keep producing pages, the stagehands were to throw him out the window.</p>\n<p>It worked. But if you’ve ever heard Rossini’s operas, and you thought there was a bit of giddy desperation to them, that’s why.</p>\n<p>Need a more actionable twist on this than hiring tough guys? Consider a business coach, or even a personal coach. Can’t afford that? Find an “accountability partner”. And yes… of course <a href="http://appcrawlr.com/ios-apps/best-free-apps-accountability-partner" target="_blank">there’s an app</a> for that.</p>\n<p>Coaches and accountability partners are especially effective if you’re doing just fine with day-to-day tasks, but you&#8217;re procrastinating on a big project that could actually change your life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Make everybody stand at meetings</h2>\n<p>Expect some blowback if you institute this. Also expect some marvelously creative excuses. But you will trim your meeting times down by a lot if everybody just stands.</p>\n<p>This is more powerful than it initially sounds. As you almost certainly know, meetings suck up an incredible amount of our time. Up to 31 hours a month, according to <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/time-wasting-at-work-infographic" target="_blank">research from Atlassian</a>. That means we’re spending nearly one full workweek every month in meetings. It gets worse: According to that same study, about half of the time in those meetings is wasted.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-23041" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/MeetingTime-1024x342.png" alt="MeetingTime" width="630" height="211" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/MeetingTime-300x100.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/MeetingTime-768x257.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/MeetingTime-1024x342.png 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/MeetingTime-600x201.png 600w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/MeetingTime.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>The problem is so bad – and so big &#8211; it’s motivated all kinds of management techniques to try to minimize meetings. Millions of dollars of software have been sold and created to try to replace meetings.</p>\n<p>So when you hear that Neal Taparia <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2014/06/19/kick-the-chair-how-standing-cut-our-meeting-times-by-25/" target="_blank">cut meeting times down</a> by 25% simply by getting people to stand, it makes you sit up and notice.</p>\n<p>Neal got thinking about the sitting issue not because of productivity. It was his health he was worried about. Alarmed by all the data supporting the idea of how “<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidsturt/2015/01/13/is-sitting-the-new-smoking/" target="_blank">sitting is the new smoking</a>”, Neal wanted to see what he could do to sit less.</p>\n<p>Meetings seemed like a good place to start. He even re-named them: “meetings” became “stand-ups”. And he took it one step further: Whenever someone spoke at these “stand-ups”, they had to hold a medicine ball. If they talked too long, their arms would get tired. So the stand-ups got even shorter.</p>\n<p>25% isn’t even the biggest cut that some people have seen in meeting times, thanks to standing. According to a <a href="https://business.missouri.edu/sites/default/files/bluedorn_turban_love_1999_jap.pdf" target="_blank">study from the University of Missouri</a>, standing versus sitting cut meeting times by 34%. That’s almost ten hours a month!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Email hacks: Optimize subject lines and use “next, next, next”</h2>\n<p>After meetings, email is the number one time sink for most workers. In fact, depending on your job and company culture, email may well be worse than meetings.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-23042" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/email-info_hero1-1024x512-1024x512.jpg" alt="email-info_hero1-1024x512" width="630" height="315" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/email-info_hero1-1024x512-300x150.jpg 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/email-info_hero1-1024x512-768x384.jpg 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/email-info_hero1-1024x512.jpg 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/email-info_hero1-1024x512-600x300.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>From Boomerang for Gmail’s infographic, <em>Insights from 5 Million Emails</em>.</p>\n<p>There aren’t any studies backing any of these up, but I’m including them anyway. Especially for #1, I think there’s a real opportunity for most of us to trim our email time down by at least 2-3 hours a week:</p>\n<h3>1. Try to distil the <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/21-tips-for-writing-emails-your-audience-cant-wait-to-open.html" target="_blank">essential message of your emails</a> down to a few words</h3>\n<p>Then use those words in the subject line. In other words: Think tweet length, not email length. This will make for longer subject lines, sure. But it means people will be able to see the gist of your email as they scan the subject lines in your inbox.</p>\n<p>Best-selling author <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/226552#ixzz2S9SbekSx" target="_blank">Jason Womack recommends</a> writing email subject lines last. Also use verbs up front so people know what to do. For example: “Hire a social media assistant: Y/N?” or &#8220;Call Susan B. today to confirm start time for Tuesday&#8217;s workshop: 415-555-xxxx.”</p>\n<p>That kind of specificity lets people know exactly what they’re supposed to do. It works because when we’re that clear on what a task involves, we tend to get it done faster.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>2. Stop surfing messages: Plow through your inbox one email at a time.</h3>\n<p>This one’s saved me a lot of time already. I noticed that when I looked at the 100+ emails in my inbox every morning, I tended to pick and choose which message to manage. Ends up, that picking and choosing takes up quite a lot of time. Now I just start with the first one and deal with it. That either means</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reply to it.</li>\n<li>Delete it.</li>\n<li>Unsubscribe from it (I am always asking myself, “can I unsubscribe from this?”).</li>\n<li>Create a filter so it automatically goes to a folder. That way I don’t have to manage each new email from this source anymore.</li>\n<li>File it for reference later. I have 300+ folders/labels for different research topics. Gmail lets you have over 600. My 300 are set up so I can assign an email to any one of them in less than 3 seconds.</li>\n<li>Put it in my “read later” folder (for late nights when I can’t sleep or times when I can’t do anything more productive).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’ve cut my inbox management time down by almost a third with this method. Many other people have too. It seems sorting emails helps a lot of us reach Inbox Zero. <a href="https://medium.com/@georgekao/a-system-for-email-productivity-cf6f959e0916#.i5ey7wjud" target="_blank">George Kao</a>, who has his own set of folders/labels, recommends saying “next, next, next” as you plow through your inbox.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Rethink your to-do list</h2>\n<p>What’s the most essential element of productivity? If you say time, I’d mostly agree with you. But what’s the second most important element?</p>\n<p>I’d say it’s not a suite of <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/25-productivity-hacks-email-marketers.html" target="_blank">productivity apps</a>. It’s not a genius filing system. It’s not even the art of delegation. It’s your energy level. We’re all so obsessed with managing time that we may have overlooked the real engine of productivity: Our energy.</p>\n<p>Productivity expert <a href="http://99u.com/articles/20556/energy-time-priority-worklife-4-new-ways-to-organize-your-to-do-list" target="_blank">Mark Vardy</a> (and other time management experts, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563/" target="_blank">like David Allen</a>) recommend sorting your to-do list by energy level. Vardy also suggests you consider sorting your list by time required or by priority. David Allen would urge you to sort your list by location: Things you can only do at the office, for example. Then things you can only do at home, or while you’re out shopping.</p>\n<p>I don’t know about the location sort, or even the time-sorted list, but I’ve had a “burnt out list” for years. It works great. My productivity tends to fall off a cliff when I’m toast, so having a list of low energy tasks really helps. It means I can still make progress even when all I can do is just lie on the couch (and watch Moz’s Whiteboard Fridays, or other <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NewGetResponse" target="_blank">YouTube videos</a>).</p>\n<p>The low energy list is almost as helpful as the high-energy list. That’s because all those niggling little tasks that have previously taken up your time will no longer take up your time when you’ve got the mojo to do <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/go-with-the-flow-and-pump-up-your-creative-productivity.html" target="_blank">big things</a>.</p>\n<p>So no more filing when you could be pitching a huge new client. No more filling out forms when there’s a presentation to practice. Get all those little housecleaning and bureaucratic chores done when you’re in a lull. Then you use your high-energy hours for tasks that deserve a spark.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>There are far weirder productivity tricks than what I’ve covered here. But I thought I’d keep it tame and focus on things that might actually help. It’s up to you to figure out if you’re like Benjamin Franklin, who believed in taking “air baths” naked. Or if you want to just chuck the productivity tricks entirely and be like <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com.au/weird-ways-to-be-more-creative-2014-12#marissa-mayer-has-slept-at-her-desk-for-maximum-productivity-6" target="_blank">Marissa Mayer</a>, who figured out how to work 130 hours every week.</p>\n<p><strong>How about you?</strong></p>\n<p>Got any strange productivity tricks that work for you?

The post covers all the fundamentals including voting, redditquette, redditors and subreddits – so if you’re feeling a bit nervous as to how you should approach the platform, then equip yourself very quickly with this wisdom and you’ll be Reddit to go!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Understanding The Reddit Market</h2>\n<p>Ok, so, if you’ve read Kerry’s post, then you will have got the fundamentals of Reddit down. But, before we delve further into the realms of Reddit marketing, it’s pertinent that we first get to grips with the demographics of the Reddit market itself.</p>\n<p>I want to turn to a <a href="http://www.bluefountainmedia.com/blog/reddit-marketing-the-complete-guide-to-using-reddit/" target="_blank">blog post from Blue Fountain Media</a>, which has very handily compiled some brilliant stats that get right to the crux of this matter. According to the Blue Fountain Media post – which garners its figures from an <a href="http://www.ignitesocialmedia.com/social-media-stats/2012-social-network-analysis-report/" target="_blank">Ignite Social Media survey</a> &#8211; Reddit is largely comprised of users between the ages of 18 and 34, who have a 65% chance of being male, and will typically be quite well educated (50% of Reddit&#8217;s community base has had at least some college education, while another 30% of users have a bachelor&#8217;s degree or higher).</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23034" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/reddit_bluefountainmedia.png" alt="reddit_bluefountainmedia" width="507" height="613" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/reddit_bluefountainmedia-248x300.png 248w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/reddit_bluefountainmedia.png 507w" sizes="(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px" /></p>\n<h6>(Image source: <a href="http://www.bluefountainmedia.com/blog/reddit-marketing-the-complete-guide-to-using-reddit/" target="_blank">Blue Fountain Media</a>)</h6>\n<h2>How To Incorporate Reddit Into Your Next Marketing Campaign</h2>\n<p>Ok, so now we know who’s on Reddit, we can get into how we can build this platform into your next social media marketing campaign.</p>\n<p>But, before we go on, I’d just like to highlight the following: Reddit users are notorious for rejecting any form of blatant advertising on the platform, and there are mediators that control subreddits with an iron fist. So, if you think you can just head over to the site and start promoting your products with gay abandon, then you need to think again.</p>\n<p>And so, the question that this blog post is really trying to answer is this: How can marketers infiltrate Reddit, which is very explicit about its aversion to marketing?</p>\n<p>Well, the short answer is quite simple – by embracing the platform as the informative, opinion-based, unique social sharing ecosystem that it is.</p>\n<p>How do we do that? Well, that of course makes up the long answer, and is what shall be covered in the remainder of this post.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Become A Redditor And Deliver Value</h3>\n<p>Yes – don’t just create an account, become an active user (aka a redditor) on the platform. Reddit is all about community – or rather, Reddit is all about communi<em>ties</em> (aka subreddits). For each and every subject and/or topic that you could possibly think of, there is a subreddit that is dedicated to it.</p>\n<p>So, say you’re in the flower business. There will be plenty of people on Reddit who are interested in flowers – but most won’t be in the flower business, like you. They will be discussing flowers, the seasons, the smells, the uses, etc. So, much like you would on your blog, you need to be joining these subreddits and contributing to the conversation. You need to share your expertise, offer advice to fellow redditors, and earn for yourself as may upvotes as you can.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Reddit is one of the very best platforms on which you can establish yourself as a thought leader in your chosen field. Once you start getting the recognition in the subreddit as having something valuable to say, only then can you gently direct fellow redditors who want more information over to your blog. But, whatever you do, you can’t blow it all by offering a two for one deal on red roses for Valentine’s Day, as you will find yourself very quickly banned from the subreddit – top of the funnel (ToFu) stuff is ok on Reddit, but middle (MoFu) and bottom (BoFu) content is absolutely not.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Use Video</h3>\n<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/videos" target="_blank">/Videos </a>is the 10th most popular subreddit on Reddit with just under 6 million subscribers. It also has 1.29% share of the traffic on the site. Indeed, 190 years of embedded video are watched on Reddit each month, and Redditors watch an average of 50-80% of total play time, according to the <a href="http://www.reelseo.com/reddit-guide/" target="_blank">reelseo.com blog</a>.</p>\n<p>Standing out on any social network means going visual in 2016, and the same applies to Reddit. But, of course, you must remember that you cannot upload promo videos onto Reddit – or, rather you can, but you will be banned from the subreddit very quickly.</p>\n<p>So, instead, you need to focus on adding value to the subreddit. How-to videos add value. Interview videos add value. And there are of course a million different ways that you can use video to add entertainment value to the subreddit. You need to get creative, but, whatever you do, <em>do not over promote your brand</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>AMA (Ask Me Anything)</h3>\n<p>I hope by now I have managed to communicate to you that marketing on Reddit is a scary – even risky – endeavour to get involved with. One wrong move and it’s not your content that can go viral, but the backlash of negativity from thousands upon thousands of redditors who will come down on you like a ton of bricks for misusing their beloved platform.</p>\n<p>And so it is with some hesitancy that I suggest to you to use the AMA feature on Reddit – it’s certainly gone wrong for some top companies in the past. REI’s CEO <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3scce7/i_am_jerry_stritzke_ceo_of_rei_and_were_closing" target="_blank">took to the site with an AMA</a>, only be criticised by his own employees. <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/01/13/nissan-reddit-ama/#nF1t.1SeQaqW" target="_blank">Nissan encountered some trouble</a> as well, when redditors accused the company of only taking questions that were planted using dummy accounts. It’s a bit of a minefield, to say the least.</p>\n<p>But, that’s not to say that it can’t be done and done well – provided that you are completely up front with the Reddit community (and of course it helps if you’ve got nothing to hide in the first place). But, an AMA is a great way to gain some added exposure of your brand on Reddit. But, once again, you can’t just go swanning in there and setting one up without having already established yourself as a valuable member of the subreddit to begin with. You need to take your time and build up your reputation, and a genuine interest in who you are and what you have to say to the community. From thereon in you can draw a deep breath and go for an AMA session – but just be prepared that you may have to fend off some pretty tough questions. That, after all, is the spirit of Reddit, and you must be willing to embrace it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>In Summary</h2>\n<p>Put very simply, Reddit marketing is not for the faint-hearted. You need to be prepared and methodical in your approach, and, above all, take your time in building your presence on the platform.</p>\n<p>Indeed, perhaps the most pertinent advice I can give you is this: don’t be a marketer, be a redditor. Everything else should then fall nicely into place.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your experiences with Reddit marketing?

These sites allow you to post your job and then receive competing offers from various people. You can hand-select the freelancer you want to work with based on skill, price, availability, or all of the above.</p>\n<p>Another website with great resources is <a href="http://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank">Fiverr</a>.

Do you think there isn’t anything you can do to get closer to this goal (apart from working hard and enjoying things you do in life, obviously)?</p>\n<p>Well, here’s <strong>lesson one: be patient</strong> – because I will not provide you with one of those “<em>How to earn 10000$ in 30 minutes</em>” kind of recipes.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson two: sometimes it is good to be a weirdo</strong> – don’t be afraid and behave a little different than others. Statistics show, it pays off to be outside the box!</p>\n<p>That being said, hopefully some of successful people’s weird habits listed below, will become an inspiration and motivation for you; then, you will be able to change your plans for the nearest future to benefit you! Needless to say, enjoying what you do for living is the base of becoming successful. Is there anything else you should do? American author Tom Coroley spent over 5 years on studying “poor and rich people’s habits.” This post presents a few of his conclusions.</p>\n<p>Below you can find six examples of what can you change in your life to become successful. Let’s get started!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>1. Prosperous people wake up 3 hours before work</h2>\n<p>This rule may seem painful for the night owls, but the mechanism is really simple – if you wake up early, your day would be longer. 3 hours is enough time to eat a nutritious breakfast, drink coffee, exercise a little, and take care of yourself &#8211; both mentally and physically. It may help you clean your mind and empower you before getting down to the grits of work.</p>\n<p>It comes to fruition in the long run, because you get extra time to respond to all your messages, write several emails, catch up with neglected duties, or prepare a report for your boss. There are many ways you can effectively spend this time on.</p>\n<p>Need a trigger? John Girsham, author of a bestseller, <em>“The Pelican Brief”</em>, used to work as an attorney. When he started writing his most famous book, he used to wake up everyday at 5 a.m., then go to the office and spend 3 hours in the morning on writing the novel. After 9 o’clock, he got down to fulfilling his regular duties. This way, he spend over 10 000 hours on writing a book.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that this creative process did not have a lot in common with his regular job (preparing interesting plot, sublime metaphors, and complex syntax do not have a lot in common with constituting court orders or divorce petitions), this habit totally paid off.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>2. They don’t watch “Keeping up with the Kardashians”</h2>\n<p>Or at least not so much <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> According to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/rich-people-daily-habits-2014-6" target="_blank">Business Insider’s statistics</a>, only 23% of successful people regularly watch reality shows or TV in general, and for less than 1 hour a day. Sitting on the couch is a rather passive form of spending time –  successful people tend to enjoy every active moment they can catch during the day. Therefore, they try to spend their spare time on physical activity such as fitness, jogging, swimming, and other kind of exercise.</p>\n<p>Influential people really care about their health and body, and calorie intake (auch!), because they believe that <strong>good health influences success</strong> and a self-assured mind is a consequence of a well-kept body. However, it is not only strong will and this life philosophy; successful people are sometimes too busy during the day to even think about swapping into coach potato mode to flip through TV channels.</p>\n<p>Same goes for the Internet and watching cute kittens or baby goats on YouTube – I agree that it may be addictive, but remember to stay reasonable while spending another hour in front of the computer screen keeping yourself superficially busy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>3. They also don’t read</h2>\n<p>…. for pleasure. Take a look at these statistics from <a href="http://assets.entrepreneur.com/article/1389897325-habits-worlds-wealthiest-people-infographic.jpg?_ga=1.213116247.218199430.1456732510" target="_blank">this Infographic</a>:</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-23002" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/successful_reading.png" alt="successful_reading" width="630" height="820" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/successful_reading-768x999.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/successful_reading-787x1024.png 787w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/successful_reading-830x1080.png 830w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/successful_reading-600x781.png 600w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/successful_reading.png 1016w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>Successful people read really a lot, but they focus mostly on topics that may occur helpful in their self-development. It does not have to be a complicated scientific book about black holes and Einstein&#8217;s theory of relativity. Follow their example – the wealthy are reading articles about interesting matters, often connected to their area of work.</p>\n<p>They are eager to learn at all times; this is why they spend their time on learning new skills and widening their knowledge about the world. You do not have to instantly say bye-bye to “<em>Game of Thrones</em>” or any other novel. If ditching your favourite novel seems to be too difficult, try to work out a compromise with yourself: every other evening read a non-fiction article. Trust me, it can be as pleasant as another page of Stark family adventures.</p>\n<p>Have ever thought about audiobooks? <a href="http://themoneyshow.co/episode-10-habits-of-rich-tom-corley/" target="_blank">Coroley’s studies</a> prove that 63% of wealthy people listen audiobooks during commute to work. So if you really try, each minute can be a productive one. You can learn a new language or listen to market news during your everyday walk to the office. Let it become your everyday routine. It is really simple and impressive (you can propose another topic for small talk in the office kitchen, imagine your friends face when you start talking to them in Spanish). Think outside the box – who said that learning can&#8217;t be pleasurable?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>4. Successful people don’t play the lottery</h2>\n<p>According to <a href="http://www.success.com/mobile/article/16-rich-habits" target="_blank">success.com</a>, over 77% of those struggling with financial difficulties, are victims of regular gambling. The rich and famous believe that it is not luck that determines their future &#8211; it is rather the considered manner of life and actions. <strong>Successful people know that they are the ones who determine their path in life</strong> – and not the croupier’s bad mood or 6 randomly chosen numbers.</p>\n<p>Try to cross out such words as “bad luck”, “lottery”, “faith” from your dictionary, and stop complaining when it comes to career matters. In other words, wealthy people don’t believe in the American Dream and success coming out of nowhere. But they are fully aware of the difference between gambling and risking, and they treat that second idea rather as a challenge than difficulty.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>5. They stay quiet</h2>\n<p>Speech is silver, but silence is golden – this cliché works perfectly well in the financial field. <strong>Successful people control their emotions, </strong>they know that not every single feeling or opinion has to be expressed in public. Be aware of the fact, that too much of emotions can destroy not only a private relationship, but also interests within your business network.</p>\n<p>Be sure to make double who and where you are speaking to before stating private opinions in business environment, for example if you love eating meat, your future investor may be not happy to hear that you think of vegetarians as posh-hipster weirdos. There is only one chance to make a first impression – do not ruin it with something unimportant.</p>\n<p>The biggest “emotional enemy” of your success is the fear of loss or making a mistake. The best way to deal with it would be by transforming depressive feelings into positive ones and beat it with action. It is time to face the truth &#8211; risk and mistakes are a part of human nature, everybody does it. Constantly keeping yourself in-check, asking “what if” will not change anything, it only leads to procrastination. If you act in such a way you are not anticipating, only prejudging the situation. After accepting this fact, making decisions will be much easier.</p>\n<p>If you want to be successful, you should also fight with a fear of meeting new people. <strong>Apparently, as the research shows, networking and volunteering have much importance in becoming successful.</strong> However, it is important to make valuable connections – it&#8217;s not the quantity that matters, but the quality. Remember that during your career you will need friends and family, but also reliable employees and business partners.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-23007" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/healthy_habits-1024x683.jpg" alt="healthy_habits" width="630" height="420" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/healthy_habits-300x200.jpg 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/healthy_habits-768x512.jpg 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/healthy_habits-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/healthy_habits-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<h2>6. They breathe</h2>\n<p>Sounds really strange, doesn’t it? But do you really know how to breathe in a conscious manner? Wealthy people put much notion into concentrating on their health and body, because they know that success also comes with the less pleasant ugly side – where you are under strain 24/7.</p>\n<p>During everyday rush the awareness of being here and now is very important – yep, you got stuck in this traffic jam, shop queue, or during a boring meeting. But still you are not in “tomorrow I have to finish the project” or “6 pm is the deadline” – lands. Be focused on your breathing, read and learn how to deal with stress (maybe audiobook in car?), and remember that success relies on your job, but also on a fulfilling personal and family life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>From Rags to Richest</h2>\n<p><strong>What you do today really matters, </strong>though, you probably will not see the results of your activities tomorrow or next week. Unfortunately, success is not built in a day &#8211; much like Rome. Compare it to being on a diet – you will not suddenly get fit after one day of self-denial. Success is a constant process, based on changing the way you live.</p>\n<p>The example of 30 million wealthy and successful people proves that thanks to little changes &#8211; one day you can join the hall of fame of successful people.

But don’t just take my word for it. Last year Ascend2 <a href="http://ascend2.com/home/wp-content/uploads/Email-Marketing-Trends-Survey-Summary-Report-150511.pdf" target="_blank">asked 300 marketer</a>s what they thought was the most useful metric for tracking email marketing results. 73% of them named click-through as #1. It even beat out conversion rate, though by a very narrow margin.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22981" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Ascend2EmailMetrics.png" alt="Ascend2EmailMetrics" width="630" height="498" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Ascend2EmailMetrics-300x237.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Ascend2EmailMetrics-768x607.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Ascend2EmailMetrics-1024x810.png 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Ascend2EmailMetrics-600x475.png 600w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Ascend2EmailMetrics.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, click-through rates also came in first for another category. The top email marketing challenges category. Yup. According to that same survey, low email click-through rates are the single biggest challenge email marketers face.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22982" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Ascend2EmailChallenges.jpg" alt="Ascend2EmailChallenges" width="630" height="501" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Ascend2EmailChallenges-300x239.jpg 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Ascend2EmailChallenges-768x611.jpg 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Ascend2EmailChallenges-1024x815.jpg 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Ascend2EmailChallenges-600x478.jpg 600w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Ascend2EmailChallenges.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>So if click-through rates are really important, but also the biggest challenge, what can we do to improve them? Well, guess what: The study asked about that, too. Here’s what your peers said works for improving click-through rates:</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22983" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Ascend2EffectivenessDifficultyEmailClickthroughRates.png" alt="Ascend2EffectivenessDifficultyEmailClickthroughRates" width="630" height="565" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Ascend2EffectivenessDifficultyEmailClickthroughRates-300x269.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Ascend2EffectivenessDifficultyEmailClickthroughRates-768x689.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Ascend2EffectivenessDifficultyEmailClickthroughRates-1024x918.png 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Ascend2EffectivenessDifficultyEmailClickthroughRates-600x538.png 600w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Ascend2EffectivenessDifficultyEmailClickthroughRates.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>If you’d like to get more clicks from your emails, keep reading. I’ll walk you through all the solutions mentioned in that graph and more. Along the way we’ll show some examples, and give you a slew of ideas for how to boost your emails’ engagement rates – and your emails’ bottom-line results.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>1. Put extra effort into your <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/give-email-targeting-superpowers-avoid-call-to-action-kryptonite.html" target="_blank">call to action</a>.</h2>\n<p>The call to action is really where the rubber meets the road for click-through rates. It’s typically where the click happens, after all.</p>\n<p>I could write you a whole ebook about how to craft a killer call to action, but let’s keep this simple. The call to action finishes this sentence: “I want you to…” Just don’t write it exactly that way. Calls to action typically perform better if you phrase them exactly the same way your subscriber would. So “Get my ebook” will do better than “Get your ebook”.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example of this from Content Verve’s ebook, <em><a href="http://e-book.contentverve.com/optimization-principles/" target="_blank">7 Universal Conversion Optimization Principles</a></em>.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22986" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/ContentVerveMyVersusYour.jpg" alt="ContentVerveMyVersusYour" width="630" height="233" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/ContentVerveMyVersusYour-300x111.jpg 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/ContentVerveMyVersusYour-768x284.jpg 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/ContentVerveMyVersusYour-1024x378.jpg 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/ContentVerveMyVersusYour-600x222.jpg 600w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/ContentVerveMyVersusYour.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>Another way to boost a call to action is to create a “curiosity gap”. This is the copywriter’s version of a cliffhanger. Just make sure you don’t go too far… otherwise you’ll disappoint your subscribers when they click through. There’s a name for misleading curiosity gaps… it’s called <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/facebook-news-feed-changes-long-click-baiting.html" target="_blank">clickbait</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>2. Segment your list.</h2>\n<p><a href="https://support.getresponse.com/manuals/contact-list-segmentation" target="_blank">Segmenting your lis</a>t is one of the most effective things you can do. Not just to increase click-through rates, but to improve your overall  results.</p>\n<p>Why does it work? Because it lets you send more relevant emails to your subscribers.</p>\n<p>Say you’re a staffing agency. You’ve got two primary types of clients: Employers and people looking for work. If you send the same email to both those groups, they’ll each have to skip over information that isn’t relevant to them. That suppresses results – including click-through rate.</p>\n<p>But if you send out two emails &#8211; one specifically designed for employers and one specifically designed for workers &#8211; then you can deliver much more relevant, valuable information. And so your click-through rates will go up.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22987" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/image361.jpg" alt="image361" width="630" height="502" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/image361-300x239.jpg 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/image361-768x612.jpg 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/image361-600x478.jpg 600w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/image361.jpg 984w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>There are many ways to segment a list. Some are more complex than others. Image courtesy of <a href="https://emailexperience.org/2014/12/the-5-stages-of-email-segmentation-sophistication-how-evolved-are-you/" target="_blank">The Email Experience Council</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>3. <a href="https://support.getresponse.com/whitepapers/increase-engagement-with-personalized-messages-dynamic-content-in-email" target="_blank">Personalize</a> your email messages.</h2>\n<p>When most of us think of email personalization, we think of using somebody’s first name in the subject line. That’s a good start, but personalization goes far beyond that.</p>\n<p>Other ways to personalize include using dynamic content. Or using other information – job title, zip code, or purchase history – to create a custom email. Depending on your list, and how you apply the technique, any one of those personalization methods can result in significant increases in click-through rates.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22988" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GetResponsePersonalization.png" alt="GetResponsePersonalization" width="630" height="566" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GetResponsePersonalization-300x270.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GetResponsePersonalization-768x691.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GetResponsePersonalization-1024x921.png 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GetResponsePersonalization-600x540.png 600w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GetResponsePersonalization.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>Only a bit more than half of email marketers are using personalization techniques.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>4. Make your emails mobile-friendly.</h2>\n<p>You’ve heard the stat on mobile emails, right? More emails are opened on mobile devices than on desktops. And that’s been true for awhile.</p>\n<p>All you GetResponse users can breathe a sigh of relief – all GetResponse email templates are mobile-friendly. But you should still be aware of the fat fingers effect – especially if you want to increase click-through rates.</p>\n<p>The “fat fingers” effect is a cute way to describe how darn hard it can be to click on a link in an email that’s been delivered to a mobile device. So to allow for the small space (and how clumsily some of us click), make your buttons at least 44 x 44 pixels wide and tall. That’s Apple’s specification for the smallest size a “click target” should be. Other designers, like <a href="https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/how-to-design-button/" target="_blank">Orbit Media</a>, recommend a mobile call to action should be at least 45 x 60 pixels.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22989" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/57_pixel.jpg" alt="Print" width="610" height="641" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/57_pixel-285x300.jpg 285w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/57_pixel-600x630.jpg 600w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/57_pixel.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></p>\n<p>But you’re not done yet. Add another 10-20 pixels of extra space on all sides, just so people can’t accidentally click a nearby link.</p>\n<p>For text links, you can keep the type the same size. Just format the email so the text links aren’t too close to each other. Again, you don’t want people to try to click one link, then accidentally trigger another link. It gets annoying after a while.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>5. Use social media icons.</h2>\n<p>A few years ago, GetResponse did a <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/social-sharing-boosts-email-ctr.html" target="_blank">study of how social media icons affect click-through rates</a>. The results were dramatic. Emails with social sharing buttons got 158% more clicks than emails without the sharing buttons.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22990" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GRSocialIconsInfographicSection.jpg" alt="GRSocialIconsInfographicSection" width="600" height="587" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GRSocialIconsInfographicSection-300x294.jpg 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GRSocialIconsInfographicSection.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>The study is a little dated now, but human behavior changes slowly. Having social media sharing buttons in your emails is definitely still a good idea.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>6. Use triggered email campaigns.</h2>\n<p>Triggered emails <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/why-autoresponders-are-perfect-for-storytelling.html" target="_blank">include autoresponders</a>, confirmation emails, <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/7-welcome-emails-that-set-the-standard.html" target="_blank">welcome emails</a>, and transactional emails. These types of messages tend to get unusually high engagement rates overall, but they also get high click-through rates.</p>\n<p>How do they do it? Easy: They strike while the iron is hot. Triggered emails come right when a prospect is interested in your business. Because of that timing – and because they tend to be highly targeted &#8211; these emails perform extremely well.</p>\n<p>Despite their strong performance record, not many email marketers are using triggered emails. At least that’s what we found when we were researching our <em><a href="http://www.getresponse.com/promo/email-marketing-benchmarks-webinar" target="_blank">State of Email Marketing By Industry</a></em> report. Only 18% of the marketers we surveyed are using triggered emails.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22991" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GetResponseTriggeredEmails.png" alt="GetResponseTriggeredEmails" width="630" height="470" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GetResponseTriggeredEmails-300x224.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GetResponseTriggeredEmails-768x573.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GetResponseTriggeredEmails-1024x764.png 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GetResponseTriggeredEmails-600x448.png 600w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GetResponseTriggeredEmails.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>That 18% is not all bad news. It means you have an opportunity to gain an edge on your competition… if you can add a few of these triggered messages to your email program.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>7. Create a sense of urgency.</h2>\n<p>Flash sales create a sense of urgency. So do news pieces and limited-time offers. Countdown timers often work well, too.</p>\n<p>Here’s a countdown timer I made for free with <a href="http://motionmailapp.com/" target="_blank">MotionMail</a>. As you can see, it works just fine with GetResponse.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22993" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/TimerCountdownTest.png" alt="TimerCountdownTest" width="630" height="459" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/TimerCountdownTest-300x218.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/TimerCountdownTest-768x559.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/TimerCountdownTest-1024x746.png 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/TimerCountdownTest-600x437.png 600w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/TimerCountdownTest.png 1126w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>To make this timer, all I had to do was specify when the end time was and how I wanted the timer to look. Then I just pasted one line of code into a GetResponse email template.</p>\n<p>There are quite a few of these email countdown timers. One of the fancier ones is <a href="http://outtatimr.com/" target="_blank">Outtatimr from Ryan Deiss</a>. It costs $50, but Deiss says it’s increased his click-through rates by 134%. With results like that, even a free email countdown timer is worth a try.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>8. Mail less often.</h2>\n<p>Mail too often, and your emails’ engagement rates will start to drop. You’ll see that show up in conversions, open rates and – yup – click-through rates. To find out if list fatigue – aka “overmailing” – is affecting your list, try mailing less often for a few weeks. If you see click-through rates start to tick up again, you may have found the problem.</p>\n<p>Want a more sophisticated solution? Offer people a way to control how often they hear from you. They’ll appreciate it.</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/chart/how-consumers-prefer-to-receive-promotions" target="_blank">chart below is from a study</a> MarketingSherpa did just last month. The results show how people answered the question, “&#8221;In which of the following ways, if any, would you prefer to receive regular updates and promotions from companies that you are interested in doing business with? Please select all that apply.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Notice how 49% of respondents said they want to “receive emails at the frequency I choose.” That’s about twice as many people who said they want to “subscribe to receive emails at a pre-determined frequency (chosen by the brand)”.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22994" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/chartofweek-022316-lp.png" alt="chartofweek-022316-lp" width="604" height="554" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/chartofweek-022316-lp-300x275.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/chartofweek-022316-lp-600x550.png 600w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/chartofweek-022316-lp.png 604w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></p>\n<p>To give you an idea of how much send frequency can affect email response rates, here’s another chart from <a href="http://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/chart/send-frequency-impact-on-read-rate" target="_blank">Marketing Sherpa</a>. Sending more than four times a week had a devasting affect on read rates. It just about cut them in half.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22995" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/chartofweek-090115-lp.png" alt="chartofweek-090115-lp" width="604" height="469" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/chartofweek-090115-lp-300x233.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/chartofweek-090115-lp-600x466.png 600w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/chartofweek-090115-lp.png 604w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>9. Test.</h2>\n<p>There are a number of other factors that can affect your emails’ click-through rates. They include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long your emails are. 100 words? 1,000 words?</li>\n<li>The type of content you include. Photos? Articles? Cartoons?</li>\n<li>The formatting of your email messages. Text, or <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/still-send-plain-text-versions-emails.html" target="_blank">HTML</a>?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You get the idea. There’s hundreds of things you could <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/9-creative-ideas-for-simple-email-split-tests.html" target="_blank">possibly test</a>. Some of them will affect your click-through rates. But you’ll have to run some a/b tests to find out.</p>\n<p>Not sure what to test? Here’s the types of tests your peers are running:</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22996" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GetResponseTesting.png" alt="GetResponseTesting" width="630" height="466" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GetResponseTesting-300x222.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GetResponseTesting-768x568.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GetResponseTesting-1024x758.png 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GetResponseTesting-600x444.png 600w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/GetResponseTesting.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>10. Resend your emails.</h2>\n<p>If all else fails, you could just send out the same email again to your subscribers. This works best if you can segment out the people who did not click or open your email the first time around. Then resend the message only to those non-openers. No need to annoy the subscribers who clicked the first time, right?</p>\n<p>Not sure this is a good idea? Not sure it’s worth it? AlchemyWorx has a <a href="http://www.alchemyworx.com/emailworx/2014/strategy/the-power-of-the-resend" target="_blank">great case study</a> that might just change your mind.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22997" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/graphpowerofresend.jpg" alt="graphpowerofresend" width="630" height="407" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/graphpowerofresend-300x194.jpg 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/graphpowerofresend-768x496.jpg 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/graphpowerofresend-1024x661.jpg 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/graphpowerofresend-600x387.jpg 600w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/graphpowerofresend.jpg 1341w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>Bonus for GetResponse users: Customize your send times with <a href="http://www.getresponse.com/features/perfect-timing-email-delivery.html" target="_blank">Perfect Timing</a>.</p>\n<p>This is a GetResponse feature that personalizes your send times. That means every subscriber gets their email message at the most likely time they’ll open it. We tested this in-house not too long ago and saw a 20% lift in click-through rates across the 5,000 accounts we tried it on.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22998" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/PerfectTiming.jpg" alt="PerfectTiming" width="630" height="333" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/PerfectTiming-300x159.jpg 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/PerfectTiming-768x406.jpg 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/PerfectTiming-1024x542.jpg 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/PerfectTiming-600x318.jpg 600w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/PerfectTiming.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>Not sure you want to personalize your send times that much? Don’t want a 20% increase in clicks? Okay… then at least try the <a href="http://www.getresponse.com/features/time-travel.html" target="_blank">Time Travel featur</a>e. It’ll send your emails to your customers at any hour you specify, but in their time zone. So no more worrying that you’re mailing to some subscribers at their 2 am, and to other subscribers at their 2 pm.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>One word of advice before I go</h2>\n<p>Click-through rates are important, but don’t put them ahead of the ultimate goal: conversions. It’s quite possible to make the mistake of boosting your click-through rates by a lot, only to end up with fewer sales. That’s not what you really want. The point was to get more clicks <em>and</em> more sales. So make sure that’s happening in every test you run.</p>\n<p><strong>Back to you &#8211; </strong>Have you tried any of the tactics listed here to improve your email click-through rates?

Keep reading to learn about some of the most successful tweets in recent history and the content that made them great.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>@BarackObama: Four more years</h2>\n<p>With three simple words and one incredible photo, President Barack Obama celebrated his election to a second term as President of the USA.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Four more years. <a href="http://t.co/bAJE6Vom">pic.twitter.com/bAJE6Vom</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Barack Obama (@BarackObama) <a href="https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/266031293945503744">November 7, 2012</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>\n<p>With no hashtag or call to action, the content that made this tweet work was the photo. It made a major moment in the USA’s history relatable, as a man and a woman who love each other celebrate a victory. You can’t help but feel an emotional connection.</p>\n<p>You may not have just been elected to your second term as President, but your content will do well when it makes emotional connections with your followers. This can include anything from staff parties, to celebrating a business win, to welcoming a new hire. Show emotions. Show excitement. Your Twitter followers will feel those emotions and share in that excitement. And by ‘share in that excitement’ I mean they’ll retweet you!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>@TheRealNimoy with all the feels</h2>\n<p>Leonard Nimoy&#8217;s last tweet contained some of the most poignant words you&#8217;ll ever come across on Twitter.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A life is like a garden. Perfect moments can be had, but not preserved, except in memory.  LLAP</p>\n<p>&mdash; Leonard Nimoy (@TheRealNimoy) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealNimoy/status/569762773204217857">February 23, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>\n<p>It was the perfect content for the perfect moment, and couldn’t help but touch the heart of all of his fans. This is another piece of content with a strong emotional appeal, like President Obama’s, to his followers. The difference, of course, is that this is a purely text-based tweet. You can not underestimate the importance of <a href="https://devumi.com/2015/06/how-to-get-twitter-followers-using-basic-psychology/" target="_blank">psychology on Twitter</a>. Emotions are a major sharing factor.</p>\n<p>For your own content needs, no one has to die. But you do need to put thought into the content you share at important moments in your account&#8217;s history. To make things easier, shareable quotes from other people are actually great pieces of content to share. Use them as part of an emotional appeal to your followers, and ask for shares. The hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23quote" target="_blank">#quote</a> can also be used in the content to find new followers who are searching this hashtag for inspiration.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>#LoveWins &#8230;wins Twitter content marketing</h2>\n<p>Not only was <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23LOVEWINS" target="_blank">#LoveWins</a> a landmark moment in the quest for equal rights, but also a fitting example of a unique way to use content to push a message. With profile pictures turning rainbow colors across Twitter and Facebook, and everyone from the President on down tweeting out the hashtag, influencers are what made this content relevant.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today is a big step in our march toward equality. Gay and lesbian couples now have the right to marry, just like anyone else. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LoveWins?src=hash">#LoveWins</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; President Obama (@POTUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/614435467120001024">June 26, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>\n<p>The hashtag was used to make an emotional appeal to a uniting event. It was short and to the point, and easily understood by all people regardless of their personal feelings toward equal marriage rights.</p>\n<p>Your Twitter account may not be able to have this deep of an impact on the world, but it can learn something from the content here. What worked so well for #LoveWins is that the momentum for this movement grew and grew as profile pictures changed to the rainbow colour scheme, as the tweets were shared, and as the content grew.</p>\n<p>Build this into your own content plans by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating profile and header images on Twitter which work in tandem with a major content push.</li>\n<li>Adding the hashtag to your header image, and even your profile’s bio.</li>\n<li>Doing this across all of your social platforms, and on your website.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Complete unification can go a long way to pushing your content even further as it creates an experience. That’s what #LoveWins really was on Twitter, and across social media: An experience we shared together.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>#PlutoFlyby: The moment we never thought we’d love so much</h2>\n<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/plutoflyby" target="_blank">#PlutoFlyby</a> was, at first, something that only the real science and astronomy geeks were following. <em>*cough*me*cough*</em> When the @NASANewHorizons account first started tweeting out content about the flyby they were smart to connect it all with the #PlutoFlyby hashtag. Why? Because of what happened once we all saw this iconic image:</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hello <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pluto?src=hash">#Pluto</a>! We’re at closest approach. Congrats to all! Follow our story &amp; view new images using <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlutoFlyby?src=hash">#PlutoFlyby</a>. <a href="http://t.co/8JVlJrcUkY">pic.twitter.com/8JVlJrcUkY</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; NASA New Horizons (@NASANewHorizons) <a href="https://twitter.com/NASANewHorizons/status/620923200621412352">July 14, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>\n<p>Once this photo went viral it gave everyone the chance to click the hashtag and discover all of the previous content. They had built out their content in advance to be found once the story broke, and every Twitter account needs to plan for their future in a similar way.</p>\n<p>This created a public space, via the hashtag, for people to communicate about what they thought about Pluto. This is the other aspect that you need to build into your content &#8211; a plan for user-generated content like this:</p>\n<p>https://twitter.com/xbluerose/status/621218550154268672</p>\n<p>Twitter is a big conversation. Plan your content to include hashtags so that your followers have a place to read opinions and share thoughts. When you <a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2015/12/ways-surprise-audience/" target="_blank">surprise your audience</a> with great content, giving them more to find via the hashtag may make the difference between liking one piece of content and liking your account.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>@NiallOfficial and the One Direction phenomenon</h2>\n<p>One Direction has to be looked at in any discussion of successful Twitter content marketing. (Sorry.) Despite their rabid fanbase, some content performs better than others. For example, content they tweet out personally, and in celebration of a milestone, typically performs better than the highly-polished stuff the PR team cranks out. Case in point:</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happy birthday <a href="https://twitter.com/Real_Liam_Payne">@Real_Liam_Payne</a> .. Have a great day man &#8230;. Here we are making strange faces <a href="http://t.co/VgZRN7VIPs">pic.twitter.com/VgZRN7VIPs</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Niall Horan (@NiallOfficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/NiallOfficial/status/637673826722152448">August 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>\n<p>This birthday wish, accompanied by silly text and a purposely embarrassing photo, did very well. All too often on social media, birthdays and major celebrations are only celebrated by the fans. Messages of congratulations are sent to the Twitter account and it makes things feel &#8230;disconnected.</p>\n<p>What Niall did here was take the time to create content which directly connected with fans. It’s similar to President Obama’s ‘Four more years’ tweet from above, except it goes in a different route. It went after a laugh instead of an ‘awwww.’ Either way, it’s a powerful emotional connection. As you learn <a href="http://smmguide.co/how-to-use-twitter-like-katyperry-really-fun-marketing-advice/" target="_blank">how to use Twitter</a>, there’s nothing more important than understanding the emotions you’re going to share through your content.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Creating great content for your Twitter account</h2>\n<p>Great Twitter moments that are shared and interacted with, whether for a branded or personal account, don&#8217;t just happen. As we learned from the examples above, it takes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Photos that connect on an emotional level.</li>\n<li>Text and quotes that are instantly impactful and inspirational.</li>\n<li>A total content plan which goes beyond the content itself, and connects with account profile and header images.</li>\n<li>A plan from the start to preserve the history of your content so that once you do go viral, there’s content ready for people to look through.</li>\n<li>Sharing moments directly with your followers, and giving them a lighter side of who you are.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While you will not be able to do each of these things with every piece of content you create for Twitter, you can build each one into your overall plan. How successful you are going to be on Twitter comes down to knowing what type of content is popular, and using this content to your advantage.</p>\n<p>Out of the four content marketing examples shown, which is your favorite?

To be honest, when it launched in 2006, it was always going to be a resounding success – there wasn’t really anything else like it.</p>\n<p>Indeed, it has to be said that out of the line up of usual suspects – Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Google+ – Instagram is undoubtedly the ‘hip’ one. There’s a coolness to the platform that I suppose stems from the fact that it’s all about showcasing amateur art in the form of photography.</p>\n<p>Users of Instagram <em>do not</em> post up pictures of what they did over the weekend, like they do on Facebook. Nor do they offer any form of written mini-blog, as is the case with the likes of Tumblr and Twitter. And, perhaps least of all would you describe Instagram as a “professional network” as you would LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>No, Instagram is about engaging and connecting with your audience through the visual medium of photography – and short videos as the site has evolved.</p>\n<p>And when I say “photography”, I mean photography. That is to say that <em>I do not mean</em> pictures, snaps, or anything similar that suggests the fickle. Now, this doesn’t mean that Instagram is lacking in all sense of fun and frivolity, for there is much photography that finds a happy home on Instagram precisely because of its wit and satire. But what it <em>does</em> mean is that there is an underlying seriousness behind the content that is posted on Instagram, and indeed the driving ethos that drives the Instagram community.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Marketing On Instagram</h2>\n<p>This of course presents a pretty large challenge for the online marketer. For, if there’s one thing that the ‘hip’ crowd on Instagram cannot abide is “in yer face” promotional posts. Some brands of course try this, but they really do stick out like a sore thumb on an Instagram news feed – and not in a good way.</p>\n<p>No, those brands that are successful on Instagram play by the rules of the platform. They produce great photography, first and foremost, and although the odd direct marketing message finds its way into the post, they do so with wit, originality and a coolness that is germane to the ethos, the audience and the network as a whole.</p>\n<p>So, how do you go about standing out on a platform such as this, whilst still playing within the “rules” and not angering an otherwise happy community by being too “in yer face” with marketing? Well, I’ve got three super cool tips that will help you get there. I hope you enjoy them, and please let us know if you have any others in the comments section below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>3 Ways To Start Getting Noticed On Instagram</h2>\n<h3>1.     Use Hashtags</h3>\n<p>In the building where I used to work in Cornwall, UK, I became very friendly with the chaps working in the next door office. They had created the <a href="https://www.socialdiningnetwork.com/" target="_blank">Social Dining Network</a> ­– a social network in its absolute infancy that brought people together over great food at local dining establishments. It’s a great idea, and am happy to say that I’m still a member.</p>\n<p>However, try as I might, I could not get through to the owners how important hashtagging was for all of their social networks, but especially their Instagram account. Indeed, even to this day, they still insist on only including their own hashtag <a href="https://www.instagram.com/socialdiningnetwork/" target="_blank">#socialdiningnetwork</a> when posting to Instagram. It’s infuriating because I genuinely believe that they could have grown to twice the size they are now if only they included a few more popular hashtags in their posts.</p>\n<p>And I’m talking really simple things here like #Cornwall, #food, #foodporn or #instafood. These are hashtags that have <em>massive </em>exposure – but who the hell has heard of #socialdiningnetwork? But that’s the hashtag that they want to be associated with, and, I’m sorry, boys, but your business growth is suffering as a result.</p>\n<p>Hashtags are the only way to search on Instagram. Users follow hashtags, and, if you want your images to be discovered, then you have to use them. There will no doubt already be a whole bunch of hashtags that are popular that surround your industry, and you can start piggy-backing these right off the bat. And then, once you’ve built up a following as a meaningful contributor to one or more of these hashtags, then you will naturally find your brand’s hashtag being used by others, and your exposure and thusly your business will grow. Please – do this for me!!</p>\n<h3>2.     Host A Photography Competition</h3>\n<p>As I went at lengths to explain in my introduction, Instagram is all about photography, not simply pictures. And so, it makes great sense to utilise the platform for the very purpose that it was built, and encourage some creativity from your followers by organising a photography competition.</p>\n<p>Now, you obviously want to tie this into your brand, and you will of course want to create a theme for the photography. So, my recommendation is to encourage entrants to take photographs that use your product in some way or another. This way, you are also engendering a culture of user-generated content that will become associated with your site – something which, in marketing terms, is priceless.</p>\n<p>Take #Oreo, for example. The famous marketing team behind everyone’s favourite cookie have created the #PlayWithOreo hashtag, which fans of the biscuit use when uploading Instagram pics using the product in unique and fun ways. Although this isn’t based on a competition, it is nonetheless a great example of what user-generated content can do to a profile. Here are a couple of recent examples.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22941" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Picture1-e1456820030728.png" alt="Picture1" width="633" height="626" /></p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22942" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/Picture2-e1456820061195.png" alt="Picture2" width="633" height="630" /></p>\n<h3>3.     Become A Curator</h3>\n<p>You should be posting regularly to Instagram – that’s a given for any platform that you want to get noticed on. But, if you really want to grow your audience, then turn your Instagram account into something that fans of your industry won’t be able to miss – and you can do this by becoming a content curator as well as creator.</p>\n<p>Whatever your industry – food, makeup, dogs, words, marketing – there is a hugely targeted following that you will be able to tap into, provided that you are constantly good for delivering the very best images to this dedicated group. Indeed, some of the best influencers on Instagram use the trick of curation to build a super-targeted following. By doing so, these marketers are essentially branding themselves as experts in their field, and make their accounts unmissable by the masses.</p>\n<p>For a great example, check out Instagram’s very own Instagram page – <a href="https://www.instagram.com/instagram/" target="_blank">@Instagram</a> – probably the most important account that any marketer can follow on Instagram, and made up entirely of curated content showcasing the very best photographs as produced by Instagram users all around the globe.

As a result, there’s been a growing demand for productivity tools to help you take control of the day. We used to think that there’s an app for everything. But as it turns out, one of the top productivity boosters is not computer software – it’s the background music to your daily work.</p>\n<p><span id="more-22946"></span></p>\n<h2> A soundtrack to your life</h2>\n<p>Music has always been an integral part of our life and culture. It can change the way we feel, make us recall memories from the past, or even influence our purchase decisions. There are a lot of companies that offer music for business purposes. Here are a couple of examples:</p>\n<p><a href="http://us.moodmedia.com/set-the-right-mood.asp" target="_blank">Mood</a> is an experience-design company that helps businesses create a unique atmosphere for customers. They offer music branding and help develop music strategies for businesses, such as background music for retail and restaurants and music to put dental patients at ease.</p>\n<p>Their website has the following statement: “Music has long been the soundtrack to our everyday lives – so it only makes sense to consider its incredible influence when setting the tone for your business environment.”</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.focusatwill.com/" target="_blank">Focus@will</a> is a neuroscience-based music service that offers specialized music proven to be extremely effective at extending attention span. After subscribing, you get access to a music player where every track has been remixed, re-edited, and scientifically remastered to help you focus, reduce distractions, and retain information when working, studying, writing, and reading.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22955" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/smartphone-vintage-technology-music-large-e1456842609764.jpg" alt="smartphone-vintage-technology-music-large" width="633" height="422" /></p>\n<h2>Some scientific research to start with</h2>\n<p>Let’s take a look at a few facts about the impact of music on the way we work and how effectively we get things done.</p>\n<h3>Music brings positive emotions and helps memory.</h3>\n<p>According to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/memory-medic/201312/does-music-help-memory" target="_blank">William R. Klemm Ph.D.</a>, a senior professor of Neuroscience at Texas A&amp;M University, listening to music that you like can increase the release of dopamine (a “feel good” neurotransmitter) in your brain. And a great deal of research has shown that positive emotions have an indirect enhancing effect on memory formation.</p>\n<h3>Positive emotions improve organizational performance.</h3>\n<p><a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/HRMID-01-2014-0012?journalCode=hrmid" target="_blank">Suzanne Hazelton</a> has researched how positive emotions boost employee engagement. It seems that positive emotions can benefit physical health, mental well-being and the ability to flourish, creativity, resilience, the mood of others, positive memories, and relationships. The positive emotions of the workforce can improve organizational culture and performance.</p>\n<h3>Music has a positive impact on the quality of work.</h3>\n<p>The general hypothesis of this <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/LESIUKarticle2005.pdf">article by Dr. Teresa Lesiuk</a> is that, in some work environments, music listening evokes a positive effect or mild positive feelings, which in turn increase performance on tasks requiring creative output. It also shows that listening to music has a positive impact on the quality of work.</p>\n<h3>Music without lyrics is less distracting.</h3>\n<p>The <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22523045">findings</a> suggest that, if you play background music in the work environment, it’s better to choose music without lyrics, because songs with lyrics are likely to reduce worker attention and performance.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22949" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/pexels-photo-large-e1456842144588.jpg" alt="pexels-photo-large" width="633" height="422" /></p>\n<h2>A few reasons to turn on some background music</h2>\n<p>Let’s look at the major arguments for playing music in the workplace, especially for those in the marketing department.</p>\n<h3>Preventing distractions</h3>\n<p>Working in marketing usually means being engaged in a lot of conversations. And that’s great, since one of the key characteristics of a healthy work environment is clear, open communication. But there are times when the people around your desk tend to be too distracting. And If habitual multitaskers are interrupted by a colleague, it takes them <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-open-office-trap" target="_blank">longer to settle back</a> into what they were doing.</p>\n<p>Unless you are a true Zen master, there’s a danger in shifting your attention from that in-depth piece of content you’ve been writing all morning when you hear an interesting conversation about the planned product features or the cake that just arrived in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>Putting the headphones on and playing your favorite music offers <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/currency-tag/the-open-office-trap" target="_blank">psychological privacy</a>, and a sense of privacy boosts job performance.</p>\n<h3>Creating personal space</h3>\n<p>Do you sometimes run out of ideas? I certainly do. If you need a moment to look at things from a different angle, playing one of your favorite tracks might be the right thing to do. Music creates personal space and may be a form of escape when you’ve been immersed in a project for a while and need a moment to withdraw and find a new perspective.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22948" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/03/pexels-photo-large-3-e1456842235852.jpg" alt="pexels-photo-large-3" width="633" height="422" /></p>\n<h2>Top online marketing activities that go better with background music</h2>\n<h3>Performing research</h3>\n<p>Browsing through the vast spaces of the Internet might sound like the best task ever, but only if you are on a mission to discover the ultimate goat GIF. If you need to back your content with precise data, it might be a tedious journey you don’t want to take in complete silence.</p>\n<h3>Adding a new post to your blog</h3>\n<p>You’ve written your next blog post. Now it’s time to add it to your content management system. I found that music helps me get through certain activities, such as formatting, SEO optimization, and scheduling.</p>\n<h3>Finding the right stock photo</h3>\n<p>We all know that a picture is worth a thousand words, but not everyone knows that finding the right one requires a million tears. The right tune in the background might spark the light of hope when it’s almost gone.</p>\n<h3>Thinking of new headlines for creatives</h3>\n<p>It’s said that five times as many people read the headlines as read the body copy. This is one of the reasons we spend so much time finding the right balance between short, compelling, and promising. You’d better create a playlist exciting enough to keep your attention on the process.</p>\n<h3>Adding and updating tasks</h3>\n<p>If you want to see positive results in your work, you need to define objectives. Your strategy must be realistic, clear, comprehensive, and flexible. That means that you’ll need to allocate time for planning, adding, and updating tasks in your schedule … sounds like it requires a soundtrack, doesn’t it?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Now that we know that music can significantly increase work performance, here’s what I’m wondering: What’s the beat behind your next email marketing campaign?</strong></p>\n\n<div class="wp_rp_wrap  wp_rp_plain" ><div class="wp_rp_content"><h3 class="related_post_title">Related posts</h3><ul class="related_post wp_rp"><li data-position="0" data-poid="in-15966" data-post-type="none" ><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/6-ted-talks-email-marketers.html" class="wp_rp_thumbnail"><img width="150" height="150" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2015/12/persuasion_content-150x150.jpeg" class="attachment-0x0 size-0x0 wp-post-image" alt="persuasion_content" /></a><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/6-ted-talks-email-marketers.html" class="wp_rp_title">6 TED Talks for Email Marketers</a></li><li data-position="1" data-poid="in-18220" data-post-type="none" ><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/10-iphone-hacks-rock-web.html" class="wp_rp_thumbnail"><img width="150" height="150" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2014/11/10-mobile-life-hacks-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-0x0 size-0x0 wp-post-image" alt="10-mobile-life-hacks" /></a><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/10-iphone-hacks-rock-web.html" class="wp_rp_title">10 iPhone Hacks That Rock the Web</a></li></ul></div></div>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.getresponse.com/whats-the-beat-behind-your-campaign.html">What&#8217;s the Beat Behind Your Campaign?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.getresponse.com">GetResponse Blog - Email Marketing Tips</a>.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://blog.getresponse.com/whats-the-beat-behind-your-campaign.html/feed";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:42:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"Why Should You Care About LinkedIn Endorsements?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"http://blog.getresponse.com/why-should-you-care-about-linkedin-endorsements.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"http://blog.getresponse.com/why-should-you-care-about-linkedin-endorsements.html#respond";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 15:13:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"MARKETING";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"http://blog.getresponse.com/?p=22926";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:647:"<p>Did you know that adding skills to your LinkedIn profile gives you 13x more profile views compared to people who don’t have them listed?

But according to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/economic-graph" target="_blank">LinkedIn’s research</a>, adding specific skills can actually increase your chances for hiring. Their latest report based on recruiting activities inside the platform gives us a solid, hard data we can’t argue with.</p>\n<p><iframe style="border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;" src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/1baibGnuM3maSm" width="668" height="714" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"> </iframe></p>\n<div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong> <a title="The 25 Skills That Can Get You Hired in 2016" href="//www.slideshare.net/linkedin/the-25-skills-that-could-get-you-hired-in-2016" target="_blank">The 25 Skills That Can Get You Hired in 2016</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="//www.slideshare.net/linkedin" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></strong></div>\n<div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"></div>\n<h2>Establish Your Professional Expertise</h2>\n<p>You can list the skills on your profile, but if you don’t enable the endorsement you may end up with a generic set of skills that looks like this:</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22933" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture7-2-e1456748035908.png" alt="Picture7" width="633" height="194" /></p>\n<p>Just take a look at how this section can be improved, by simply letting people endorse you for what you’re good at:</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22928" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture2-2-e1456747912924.png" alt="Picture2" width="633" height="640" /></p>\n<p>Source: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/annhandley" target="_blank">Ann Handley LinkedIn profile</a></p>\n<p>Not only does having endorsements look better, but it also serves as social proof. It’s that little extra thing that people pay attention to while making decisions. Your profile and endorsements sell your skills. Just think about it. It’s the same recommendation mechanism that works well for any retailer trying to sell their products. Make this easier for your connections by enabling endorsements in your “Edit profile” section:</p>\n<p><strong> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22929" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture3-2-e1456747865540.png" alt="Picture3" width="633" height="244" /></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>See How Others See You</h2>\n<p>This is closely connected to establishing your professional expertise. You can only list 50 skills in your profile, so just add them and ask people to endorse you, or wait for your connections to suggest skills they think you have. Don’t worry – it’s always up to you if you want to add these suggestions or not.</p>\n<p>There are people who think skill suggestions are irrelevant and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/how-to-fix-linkedins-biggest-annoyances-1567460670" target="_blank">treat them as a big annoyance</a>. Sometimes it’s perfectly understandable, especially if connections that you’ve never worked with directly add some crazy suggestions like Ruby on Rails for a lawyer’s profile.</p>\n<p><em>Some people endorse you based on their personal experiences with you, while others rate you based on your reputation and assumptions about you. Sometimes it can be very revealing about who your peer group really thinks you are. </em>– Says Scott M. Soltz in <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-endorse-me-on-LinkedIn-for-skills-I-dont-have" target="_blank">this Quora conversation</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But, more often than you think, the annoyance comes from the fact that your connections think you can do more than you give yourself credit for. And this can make you feel uncomfortable. Well, guess what:</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22930" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture4-2-e1456748137116.png" alt="Picture4" width="633" height="448" /></p>\n<p>You should really embrace it as an opportunity to learn (not fake ;)) and improve. Develop the skills your connections say you have. Learn something new in the process. And after that, confidently add their suggestions to your profile.</p>\n<p>But remember – don’t add every crazy thing that comes to their mind…</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>From Window Cleaning to Star Wars – it’s all there</h2>\n<p><em>Turns out, there are some pretty weird things you can endorse people for on LinkedIn. </em>– says Brooke Torres in one of her <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/79-linkedin-endorsements-you-didnt-know-existed" target="_blank">articles on themuse</a>. Just take a look at the list she’s gathered.

But do you want to do it? That’s a whole another discussion. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<h2>Start a Conversation</h2>\n<p>It’s great to genuinely connect with other people on LinkedIn . It’s great some of them want to give you credit for something you’re good at. Take it.</p>\n<p>Even if you’ve never met them, but you see they have endorsed your skills, always say “Thank you”. Start a conversation. Not only is this a chance to deepen the connection, but also an opportunity to know why they took the time to check your profile and confirm you have the skills. You may also return the favor by endorsing someone too. But, just like Liam Neason in the video below: don’t endorse just anyone <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lp3daXxkng4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>\n<p>What skills do you have listed on your LinkedIn profile? Do you use endorsements? Do you think they bring value to the platform and your LinkedIn activity?

Well, according to Salesforce, a leading CRM platform, simply because you can grow your accounts faster, find new customers faster, and close deals faster — from anywhere.</p>\n<p>As competition becomes fiercer, building relationships with potential customers has become more challenging. In order to become successful, you need to recognize and make the most of each stage in your sales pipeline.</p>\n<p>At some point it’s impossible to track all your customer relationships. That’s why sooner or later you need a computer system to help you handle everyday tasks and stimulate business growth (I’m sure you don’t want to limit your business with your memory).</p>\n<p>Since you are reading this blog, I’m sure you know the reasons for using a professional email marketing platform (it allows you create beautiful emails that look great on any device, send automated follow-ups, or even create, publish, and host high‑converting landing pages &#8211; to name a few).</p>\n<p>But do you know why you should be using a customer relationship management software? Let’s take a look at some of the most obvious reasons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Keeping your team informed</h3>\n<p>A CRM system keeps all the customer data in a central location. Your team has constant access to activity history, key contacts, customer communications, and internal account discussions. All you need to do is provide the right people with access to the information that allows them do their job.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Making better, data-driven decisions</h3>\n<p>With a CRM system you can instantly dig deeper into sales intelligence. You can quickly access the most relevant data in your sales pipeline, helping you to keep track of all your tasks and events, and allowing you to see what works best and leads to a higher conversion. Look at the leads, opportunities, and prospects you are working with. You can go through each stage of the sales cycle, eliminate potential issues, and optimize your sales strategy.  With hard data it’s much easier to predict income and set realistic sales quotas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Increase productivity</h3>\n<p>Your team of sales reps can see sales intelligence, detailed company information, and multiple leads on a single screen, so they can build pipeline quicker than ever.</p>\n<p>You can also design and automate business processes (e.g., approvals for deal discounts or travel expenses).</p>\n<p>The system allows your team to share files, discuss them, publish, and track the content in real time.

The ways in which we interact, develop relationships, speak and listen — even how we make purchasing decisions — can all be discerned through fundamental psychological functions. The brain is the epicenter and master filter of all that we inevitably purchase, or decide against purchasing.</span></p>\n<p><span id="more-22880"></span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a marketer, you need to aim your strategy towards the precipice of this great filter. Where the master controller of the mighty purse strings lays dormant. Empathetically fight your way inside the consumer mind to better understand what makes us, as humans, tick. Why do we interact with others? Why do we develop intimate relationships with inanimate objects? Why do we love and laugh; and why do we decide to buy the 10 piece pack of gum for $1.99 at the counter, instead of the 400 piece mega pack in the back of the store for $4 bucks?</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychology is zany. That’s what makes it interesting. Let’s discuss the psychology behind your content marketing, and how you can harness the power of human nature to boost your brand online.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>1) Urgency</b></h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within your content, it’s important to create a sense of urgency. Whether it’s through design or verbiage, a marketer can present powerful psychological cues to assist the consumer’s brain in responding.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out the email blast below. This was sent to me by Banana Republic, the title of the email reads, “Cardmembers: Your special offer ends today!” Right off the bat, they’re creating a sense of urgency. In fact, I clicked into this email to read the offer, whereas I normally just let this address go to my spam box (to my dismay, it was only 15 percent off, which isn’t a good enough value for me &#8211; a topic we’ll touch on later in this article). Take a look at some of the words and phrases in Banana Republic’s email: “Don’t miss”, “Exclusively”, “Ends today”.</span></p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22883" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/banana-republic-urgent-messaging-e1456410439825.png" alt="banana-republic-urgent-messaging" width="633" height="720" /></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the right verbiage will go a long way in creating a sense of urgency in your digital marketing. Using similar phrases as above, such as, “Act now!” “Don’t miss out!” “Limited quantity!”, will work well in building urgency within your strategy. It’s proven that urgent situations cause people to behave impulsively in response to high levels of emotion — as a marketer, you can use this to your advantage. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A general known fact in online marketing is that conversions are higher when there’s less friction on the purchase path. It’s bad when people think too long, there’s no call-to-action (CTA) immediately available or there’s a broken link. These problems can impede sales numbers. And that’s no good for anyone. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>2) Scarcity</h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you know of Black Friday? Scarcity states that people place a higher value on an object that is limited and a lower value on those that are abundant. The fact that there exists an item that we want but can’t have drives many consumers to make heaps of unplanned purchases every year. It creates competition, and we all know how competitive humans can get (especially when $100 flat screens are involved!).</span></p>\n<p>Have you ever been bombarded by someone who wants you to tune in to their webinar? They’ll say, “Hurry, there’s only a (insert tiny number here) spots left!” Future you may not even truly care about attending the webinar, but the marketer happened to trigger that portion of your brain the right moment. Present-time you thinks that future you will be better off with clicking the “register” button. Check out Dr. Dobias’ urgent-as-hell post below. He even asks people to “de-register to allow others to come,” if you can’t make it, of course.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22888" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/only-5-spots-left-psychology-marketing.png" alt="only-5-spots-left-psychology-marketing" width="506" height="512" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/only-5-spots-left-psychology-marketing-296x300.png 296w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/only-5-spots-left-psychology-marketing.png 506w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" /></p>\n<p>&#8230;Are that many people really falling for this? What a time to be a digital marketer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countdown</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same vein as scarcity, a countdown encourages action by creating a sense of urgency. Take a look at Amazon’s lightning deals, where they present a countdown timer, or clock. This gives the user a known amount of time to purchase the item, heightening anxiety and increasing their likelihood of acting on this limited time opportunity. Not only is this good for increasing sales, it’s a nice way to get rid of lingering SKUs and sell bundles of products.</span></p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-22890" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/amazon-urgent-marketing-lightning-deals-1024x349.png" alt="amazon-urgent-marketing-lightning-deals" width="1024" height="349" /></p>\n<h2>3) Color Design Psychology</h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s possibly no better place to utilize psychological marketing than in your design. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Color psychology has long been utilized as determinant of human behavior. For example, we see red, orange, yellow and feel energy, excitement, happiness and power. When we see green, blue and purple, on the other hand, we feel loyalty, calmness, sophistication and trustworthiness. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, great boilerplate. While you should adhere to that general rule of thumb, also realize that increasing conversions is often more complex than just using </span><a href="http://thinksem.com/blog/ctas-color-versus-contrast/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">red or green</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Using contrasting colors may be your website’s most compelling feature in the hunt for sales. ThinkSEM writer Kayla Hollatz states it simply, “The higher the contrast between elements on the page and the CTA, the more attention is directed toward the button. The more attention drawn, the better likelihood of that visitor clicking the button.”</span></p>\n<p>As we can see on SEO kingpin Moz’s site, it’s mostly made up of cooler colors; blues, whites, purples, greens, what have you. But the most important element, the CTA that they want their visitor to click on is — you guessed it — it’s complementary friend, yellow! Moz’s end goal is to sell their line of SEO products. So they immediately present you with their most important step in the sales process. They’ve removed every element of sales friction from their end by making the most obvious step the first thing you see.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-22887" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/moz-contrast-cta-1024x392.png" alt="moz-contrast-cta" width="1024" height="392" /></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to logos, some companies, choose a single color for their logo, Such as Target using red. McDonald&#8217;s and countless other companies, however, use two colors which modifies consumer’s perception of the company. While Target’s red is clean, vibrant and easy-to-read from the road, McDonald’s red and yellow arches are high contrast, almost in-your-face easy-to-read from the road, and has actually been shown to </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-honigman/psychology-color-design-infographic_b_2516608.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stimulate hunger</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As your identifying mark, making a memorable logo is important, and reinforcing the related colors in your content is even more so.</span></p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22894" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/target-logo.jpeg" alt="target-logo" width="600" height="600" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/target-logo-150x150.jpeg 150w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/target-logo-300x300.jpeg 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/target-logo.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-22882" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Mcdonalds_Logo-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Mcdonalds_Logo" width="1024" height="1024" /></p>\n<h2>4) Reward &amp; Be Rewarded</h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another fundamental of human psychology is that we strive to make progress in our lives. Whether it’s growing up, beating a video game or running a marathon, we set short term objectives to reach long term goals. Going to college and getting a job, eating the blue ghosts, or running a 5k are all objectives of the stated longer term goals. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The psychology of the need to progress can be harnessed and applied directly to your content marketing. I’m sure you know of the ‘ol buy stuff, get more of that stuff free deal. It used to be brick-and-mortar only, where you’d carry around a wallet-sized card for weeks (or years in my case) and slowly, you’d make enough progress — aka, spend enough money — that you’d finally get your free … well, whatever it was that you were buying. I have dozens of these cards. They’re almost like snapshots of my life at the certain times I started using them. Take a look at my faded, leather-stained Mesa Pizza card. This is from my college days, interrupted at six pathetic slices. I always felt like I graduated too soon. This just proves it.</span></p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-22885" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/IMG_5104-e1456410746363-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_5104" width="1024" height="768" /></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While these cards are still in heavy circulation today, they’ve also been updated for digital. You see this content tactic everywhere. Perhaps the worst offenders are mobile gaming apps, which you can download for free, progress to a certain stage in the game and then have to fork up dough just to keep playing. This situation is hilariously parodied in a South Park episode titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freemium Isn&#8217;t Free</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  The show explains comedically, &#8220;With mobile apps, we now can make games that are boring and stupid, but if you pay for incentives, you&#8217;re rewarded.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4duJdeKTwHY" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this may be a crude way to look at it, when done tastefully, this strategy can become a great way to incentivize and reward customers to successfully generate sales. Krispy Kreme and Starbucks for example have their reward program on point. Which makes sense, because food is one of the best industries for reward programs.</span></p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22895" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/krispy-kreme-rewards.png" alt="krispy-kreme-rewards" width="506" height="900" /></p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-22886" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/starbucks-reward-577x1024.jpg" alt="starbucks-reward" width="577" height="1024" /></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you aren’t slinging donuts or pressing espressos, there are ways to work in a rewards/incentive program into your digital strategy. The trick is to find your added value. an improvement or addition to something that makes it worth more than the price. For example, offering free tech support on a new laptop would be a value-added feature. Additionally, individuals can add value to their services, such as bringing advanced legal knowledge to a legal case in which an attorney’s client doesn’t foresee the need for such abilities.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get creative in your quest to develop the perfect value added rewards program for your business. General Plumbing Supply, for example, has developed a “Trip Reward Program”, a limited time only (urgency!) event where shoppers get 5 points every time they spend $100. Save up 1,000 points and you’re entered into a chance to win a trip to Mexico.</span></p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22889" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/plumbers-reward-program-e1456410932217.png" alt="plumbers-reward-program" width="633" height="440" /></p>\n<h2>5) Price or Value?</h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price and value are two completely different things. As Warren Buffet famously stated, “Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.” For most people price itself isn’t the deciding factor when a potential purchase is being made. Paul Christ, author of </span><a href="http://www.knowthis.com/marketing-book" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">KnowThis Marketing Basics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, expands on Warren’s vague-yet-philosophical viewpoint:</span></p>\n<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the buyer, value of a product will change as its perceived price paid and/or perceived benefits received change. But the price paid in a transaction is not only financial, it can also involve other things that a buyer may be giving up. For example, in addition to paying money a customer may have to spend time learning to use a product, pay to have an old product removed, close down current operations while a product is installed or incur other expenses.”</span></i></p>\n<p>As we can recognize, value can include more than just price. So while that new laundry/dryer combo machine may be for sale at a great price (for a limited time only!), is it worth it to spend an entire afternoon hauling the incredibly heavy and old machines out of your basement, up your tiny staircase and to the dump? Unless your wife is nagging you or you’ve sprung an ungodly leak, meh, you can leave it for the next people who move in.</p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to implement this idea into your online marketing strategy, you need to understand the value of what you offer. If you offer flight lessons for $400, that might seem like a lot. But, given the right situation, if the consumer can understand what an exclusive and rewarding skill they’ll be learning, the value will rise and the expense will fall by the wayside. Communicate the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">actual </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">benefits and the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">perceived </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">value to give the consumer an entirely clear picture of what you’re offering.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychological Pricing</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In relation to price vs. value, price point is another psychological marketing strategy based on the theory that specific prices cause a specific reaction in the psyche. Consumer behavior dictates that a shopper perceives an “odd price” as significantly lower than what they actually are. If a gallon of gas is priced $1.99, the consumer relates that amount to the lower $1 than the closer and higher cost, $2. Consumers ignore the least significant digits rather than do the proper rounding.

Understanding the fundamentals that drive human behavior is imperative in your quest towards content domination. What you should understand is that testing your content against psychological cues will be the only way you can understand the successes and failures of your tactics. Don’t just throw a bunch of red on your website and call it a success. Fuse the two practices to better control your marketing strategy and improve your website, whether it’s through a rewards program, better copy and design, or varying prices.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><img class="alignleft wp-image-22897 size-thumbnail" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/tim-brown-tim-b-design-digital-designer-150x150.png" alt="tim-brown-tim-b-design-digital-designer" width="150" height="150" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/tim-brown-tim-b-design-digital-designer-150x150.png 150w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/tim-brown-tim-b-design-digital-designer.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>About the author</strong>: Tim Brown works at <a class="" href="https://www.snapagency.com/services/web-design/" target="_blank">Snap Agency &#8211; Web Design Minneapolis</a>, doing big things and creating websites and promoting those for clients through Content Marketing and SEO.

You know which tasks are worth your time, and which aren’t.</p>\n<p>To give you some idea of how your hourly value compares to your peers, consider the chart below. It’s from a <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/the-state-of-email-marketing-by-industry.html" target="_blank">survey</a> of online business owners done by <a href="http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/youngbizsurveyreport.pdf" target="_blank">Google</a>.</p>\n<p>Most of the small business owners in this group value their time to be worth at least  $100 an hour. With a figure like that to work with, outsourcing some work – even up to $75 an hour – starts to look like a good deal.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22859" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture1-1.png" alt="Picture1" width="487" height="347" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture1-1-300x214.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture1-1.png 487w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /></p>\n<p>It also starts to make automation look extremely attractive. According to that chart, saving even 2 hours a week nets out to thousands of dollars a year.</p>\n<table width="207">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width="55">Value of an Hour</td>\n<td width="152">Value of 2 hrs a week saved over the course of a year</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="55"> $50</td>\n<td width="152"> $5,200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="55"> $100</td>\n<td width="152"> $10,400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="55"> $200</td>\n<td width="152"> $20,800</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="55"> $300</td>\n<td width="152"> $31,200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="55"> $400</td>\n<td width="152"> $41,600</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="55"> $500</td>\n<td width="152"> $52,000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>That’s the perspective I’d like you to hold while you read the rest of this post. Learning new automation tools is not everybody’s idea of a good time. But if you can shave even an hour or two of time off your to-do list every week, there are real benefits to be had. Like an additional employee. Or a new car.</p>\n<p>If you’re already using If This Then That (IFTTT), keep reading anyway. You might pick up a few tricks. But if you’re not, it’s time to at least try. So I’ve laid out detailed instructions on how to do a few basic tasks. And no excuses about how you can’t afford it. IFTTT is free.</p>\n<p>So what is it? It’s an app that lets you get other apps, websites, devices and services to talk to each other. The kind of stuff that most of us think we need an expensive developer to set up. Except we don’t.</p>\n<p>IFTTT’s uses go way beyond just business applications. It can help with everything from <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/why-community-management-is-easier-than-having-a-toddler.html" target="_blank">parenting</a> to home security, fitness to financial management. It can talk to refrigerators, lamps, garage door openers, your email, your music or your car. For this post, we’re just focused on basic digital marketing tasks.</p>\n<p>One word of warning about IFTTT. Many of the recipes I read about I couldn’t actually get to work. Many of them do work, of course. But after testing over 20 different recipes, I’ve come to be cautiously optimistic when I come across a new recipe. All the recipes listed here do work – I have personally tested them.</p>\n<p>There is a bit of setup to do but before we jump in. It’ll take less than 15 minutes. Here’s what you need to do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create an IFTTT account.</li>\n<li>Download the IFTTT app for your phone. This will let you manage your account on the go. It will also streamline the process for notifications and a few other features. Get the app for iPhone <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ifttt/id660944635" target="_blank">here</a> and the one for Android <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ifttt.ifttt&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">here</a>. There are tablet apps, too.</li>\n<li>To speed up the process of running “recipes” (that’s what IFTTT calls the automated actions it takes) connect a couple of services (called “channels”) you use often. These are a good start:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">\n<li>Gmail</li>\n<li>Facebook</li>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n<li>Buffer</li>\n<li>Google Drive</li>\n<li>SMS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To connect a channel, go to the “Channels” link in the top navigation. Then search for the site, device or service you want to connect.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22860" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture2-1-e1456328800447.png" alt="Picture2" width="633" height="565" /></p>\n<p>Click on the icon for the channel, then click on the big blue connect button on the next page.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22861" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture3-1-e1456328855168.png" alt="Picture3" width="633" height="347" /></p>\n<p>You’ll be asked to log into the service, and then you’re done. The service is connected to IFTTT.</p>\n<p>Not too hard, right? So let’s set up some recipes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1) Automatically <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/388919-pin-tagged-facebook-photo-post-to-a-specific-pinterest-board" target="_blank">share from Facebook to Pinterest</a>.</p>\n<p>Facebook is getting more an more visual, and Pinterest is starting to drive serious traffic for some people. So let’s hook them up. This recipe has some extra features that make it particularly useful.</p>\n<p><a id="embed_recipe-388919" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_60" href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/388919-pin-tagged-facebook-photo-post-to-a-specific-pinterest-board" target="_blank"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/388919" alt="IFTTT Recipe: Pin Tagged Facebook Photo Post to a Specific Pinterest Board connects facebook-pages to pinterest" width="370px" /></a><script src="//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js" async="" type="text/javascript"></script></p>\n<p>Just click Add to add this to your recipes. Then go up to the top navigation again and click “My Recipes”. You’ll see the new recipe in the list, like this:</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22862" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture4-1-e1456329114650.png" alt="Picture4" width="633" height="335" /></p>\n<p>Click the pencil icon on the far right. You’ll be able to edit the recipes from the next page:</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22863" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture5-1-e1456329229868.png" alt="Picture5" width="633" height="752" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are other recipes that will pin any photo you <a href="https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal/33940244" target="_blank">upload to Pinterest</a>, but I like the extra control this particular recipe has.</p>\n<p>It will only pin images that you’ve added a specific hashtag to. That means you don’t have to post everything from <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/pinterest-power-tips-turn-content-pro.html" target="_blank">Facebook to Pinterest</a>. It also means you can specify which Pinterest board you add the image to.</p>\n<p>Say you wanted to add Facebook photos to three different boards. You could create three different recipes, set each one up with its own hashtag and board, and then quickly add different photos to those three Pinterest boards.</p>\n<p>Being able to sort the images like that makes for more relevant Pinterest boards. If you were a graphic designer, for instance, you might want a board for ebook and report covers you’ve created. You could create another board for direct mail pieces you’ve created, and another for websites you’ve designed.</p>\n<p>Here’s how it looks in action. I post a new photo on Facebook – with the “#pin” hashtag:</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22864" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture6-1-e1456329605398.png" alt="Picture6" width="633" height="667" /></p>\n<p>And voilà – it appears on the Pinterest board:</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22865" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture7-1-e1456329647278.png" alt="Picture7" width="633" height="364" /></p>\n<p>Sometimes it takes 10-15 minutes for the new pin to appear.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Want to do this in reverse? You can also automatically post whatever images you pin on <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/307975-pinterest-to-facebook-page" target="_blank">Pinterest to Facebook</a>. And you can also automatically share any new <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/307976-pinterest-image-to-twitter-as-image" target="_blank">Pinterest pin to your Twitter account</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2) When someone on Twitter tweets with a specific hashtag, <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/230413-build-a-twitter-list-from-a-specific-hashtag" target="_blank">add them to a specific Twitter list</a></p>\n<p>I love the idea of Twitter lists, but the idea of sorting through the 3,000+ people I follow on Twitter gives me a headache. So I figured out how to automate it.</p>\n<p>Here’s the recipe to make it happen:</p>\n<p><a id="embed_recipe-230413" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_44" href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/230413-build-a-twitter-list-from-a-specific-hashtag" target="_blank"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/230413" alt="IFTTT Recipe: Build a Twitter list from a specific hashtag connects twitter to twitter" width="370px" /></a><script src="//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js" async="" type="text/javascript"></script></p>\n<p>As before, just click the big blue Add button, then go find the added recipe in the “My Recipes” section. Click the pencil icon in the listing to edit the recipe.</p>\n<p>Here’s the settings:</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22866" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture8-1-e1456329779236.png" alt="Picture8" width="633" height="572" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can keep things simple and just add people to a Twitter list based on one hashtag, like I’ve done here. Or you can use <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/71577#" target="_blank">Twitter’s advanced search operators</a> to create a much more defined list. I got it to work with two hashtags – here’s the <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/388948-create-twitter-list-from-people-who-use-two-hashtags" target="_blank">link</a> to that recipe.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22867" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture9-1-e1456329884804.png" alt="Picture9" width="633" height="362" /></p>\n<p>This works best if you create the Twitter list in your Twitter account first. If you’ve got the IFTTT app installed on your phone, you can also set the recipe up to send you notifications every time it’s triggered. That’s fun for the first ten times or so (just to confirm it’s working), but you’ll probably want to turn notifications off after that. <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/new-research-on-what-really-works-for-improving-productivity.html" target="_blank">Notifications reduce your productivity</a>.</p>\n<p>There’s a variation on this recipe that might be really great for your promotion work. You can add anyone who’s mentioned you on Twitter to a specific <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/231308-automatically-add-users-who-mention-you-to-a-twitter-list" target="_blank">Twitter list</a>.</p>\n<p>Here it is in action:</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22868" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture10-1-e1456329992765.png" alt="Picture10" width="633" height="276" /></p>\n<p>Why do this? Because anyone who’s mentioned you is at least sort of interested in your work. They might be worth reaching out to later if you’ve got a blog post or another piece of content to promote.</p>\n<p>You could get even fancier and add their Twitter handle to a <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/238087-if-customer-mentions-you-on-twitter-add-a-row-to-google-drive-spreadsheet" target="_blank">Google Drive spreadsheet</a>. It all depends on how you want to use their information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3) Get text messages within minutes after a new blog post is published.</p>\n<p><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/definitive-guide-blog-commenting.html" target="_blank">Blog commenting</a> is still one of the most underused tactics around. I wouldn’t use it specifically for link building, but it’s an ideal way to <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/are-you-making-the-most-out-of-influencer-marketing.html">build relationships with influencers</a>.</p>\n<p>Trouble is, on really popular blogs, by the time you get the email announcing their new post, up to a dozen other people may have commented already. That means your comment gets buried. As a result, your comment &#8211; and you &#8211; get far less exposure.</p>\n<p>So beat everybody to the punch. Set up this recipe to get a text message within minutes after a post has been published. All you need is the blog’s feed URL and the ability to receive text messages. When I tested this, I got a text message about 23-16 minutes after a post was published. It’s not perfect, but it’s good enough to get your comment near the front of the line.</p>\n<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/113483-send-sms-alert-for-new-blog-post" target="_blank">Here’s the recipe</a>:</p>\n<p><a id="embed_recipe-113483" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_32" href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/113483-send-sms-alert-for-new-blog-post" target="_blank"><img style="max-width: 100%;" src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/113483" alt="IFTTT Recipe: Send SMS alert for new blog post connects feed to sms" width="370px" /></a><script src="//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js" async="" type="text/javascript"></script></p>\n<p>Here are the settings:</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22869" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture11-1.png" alt="Picture11" width="563" height="590" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture11-1-286x300.png 286w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture11-1.png 563w" sizes="(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px" /></p>\n<p>Try this out with 3-5 blogs that you’d either like to <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/guest-posting-101-receive-max-roi-promotion.html" target="_blank">guest post</a> for, or where you’d like to build a relationship with the blogger.

Four Key Recruiting Trends to Watch in 2016</h2>\n<p>We start with a quick reminder of the LinkedIn survey on Global Recruiting Trends in 2016. In this infographic, you get the gist of four leading trends. But If you want detailed data, download the entire document and dig in!</p>\n<p>Key Takeaways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quality of hire turns out to be the most important metric of recruitment success.</li>\n<li>Finding quality talent is all about social networking and employer branding. (Note that employee referrals are among peaking trends.)</li>\n<li>To have your recruitment effort pay off, make retention a priority.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/global-recruiting-trends-e1456323334968.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22844 size-large" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/global-recruiting-trends-147x1024.jpg" alt="global-recruiting-trends" width="147" height="1024" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: LinkedIn</em></p>\n<h2>2. Retain Top Talent Before It’s Too Late</h2>\n<p>Getting the best-of-the-best on board isn’t easy. So take a close look at your retention game plan. Here’s a suggestion for keeping your talent loyal – cater to their need to stay engaged.</p>\n<p>Key Takeaways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>High turnover ratio equals your hard-earned money going down the drain. It can add up to 1/5 of payroll costs!</li>\n<li>The manager’s interpersonal skills, such as listening and coaching, are a significant influence. And there is power in positive recognition.</li>\n<li>Engaged employees place trust in the organization they work for. So stick to open communication about the business — the good and the bad.</li>\n<li>A sense of purpose carries weight with Millennials. Make sure they can relate their specific work to the overall mission of the company.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/1200px-Retain-Top-Talent-Before-Its-Too-Late-e1456323386235.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22842 size-large" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/1200px-Retain-Top-Talent-Before-Its-Too-Late-246x1024.png" alt="1200px-Retain-Top-Talent-Before-Its-Too-Late" width="246" height="1024" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: YouEarnedIt</em></p>\n<h2>3.

This infographic gives you neatly presented insights on how to benefit from online recruiting.</p>\n<p>Key Takeaways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook and Twitter are useful for employer branding projects and employee referrals.</li>\n<li>LinkedIn is used mainly to search, track and contact candidates.</li>\n<li>LinkedIn wins first place among social networks used by recruiters. And yet, more than half of recruiters use two or more sites when scouting for talent.

How to Put Your Best Foot Forward on Your LinkedIn Profile</h2>\n<p>So far, we’ve learned that LinkedIn is a powerful tool in the hands of recruiters. This link has practical tips for job seekers on how to build your online presence with a complete, comprehensive LinkedIn profile.</p>\n<p>Key Takeaways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t be a string of digits and letters. Customize the URL of your profile and post it on all the platforms you use for professional purposes.</li>\n<li>Be creative when coining descriptions, but avoid ostentation. Terms such as ninja, guru or wizard reduce your credibility with recruiters.</li>\n<li>Make your summary appealing but brief. Focus on your experience section. Briefly introduce the employer and share your work samples if possible.</li>\n<li>Work on your social network. Get reciprocal recommendations. Give “likes”and “follows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/best-face-forward-web-01-e1456323621904.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22843 size-large" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/best-face-forward-web-01-544x1024.png" alt="best-face-forward-web-01" width="544" height="1024" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: Spring Professional</em></p>\n<h2>5.

When we’ve got enough time, we find ourselves short on money.<span id="more-22745"></span></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, many of us feel short on both fronts all the time.</p>\n<p>Assuming your budget and time constraints aren’t too severe, most of us do decide to spend a little money to save a bit of time. We don’t make our own shoes, for example. And (unless we call it a hobby) we find it more expedient to buy vegetables than to grow them.</p>\n<p>If you run a small business, you have to make time versus money decisions constantly. There’s no way around it.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, you get lucky. You find a new trick that saves time and costs nothing. Or you spy a new shortcut that costs a wee bit, but saves several hours. That’s what this post is for. All of the online services mentioned below can free up several hours of time every week. Some are for your professional life, others are for your personal one. Hopefully, all of them will be affordable enough to easily be worth paying for.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>1) Amazon Prime. Or any other fast, free shipping service.</h2>\n<p>Have you ever calculated how much time you spend running errands? Stopping by a store for this… making an extra trip for that. It adds up. Even conservatively, each one of those extra trips takes out half an hour of your day.</p>\n<p>Enter <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-One-Year-Membership/dp/B00DBYBNEE" target="_blank">Amazon Prime</a> – or any other online retailer you can find that offers free, fast shipping.</p>\n<p>Don’t skip over those two criteria. The shipping has to be free, or you’ll lose ground on the money part of this time-saving tip. And it has to be fast, otherwise you won’t be willing to wait for your stuff to get to you. You’ll just run out to the store instead.</p>\n<p>This works especially well if you obey the rule of twos. If there’s a basic product you know you’ll continue using, when you run out, buy two. Never buy just one.</p>\n<p>Buying two cuts your restocking time in half. It means you’re less likely to look into a cabinet and not have what you need immediately. It also means that if you use things that aren’t always available (even from stores), you’ll have a stash on hand.</p>\n<p>The con to this? You’ll need to have your cabinets and storage reasonably organized. And you’ll need enough storage space for your backups. Usually that’s not a problem, but some of you city-dwellers in micro-apartments don’t have a lot to work with.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22748" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/AmazonFresh-1024x481.jpg" alt="AmazonFresh" width="630" height="296" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/AmazonFresh-300x141.jpg 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/AmazonFresh-768x361.jpg 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/AmazonFresh-1024x481.jpg 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/AmazonFresh.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>Want to save three hours or more a week?

Stuff like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having your dog picked up, brought to a vet appointment, and brought back home.</li>\n<li>Getting someone to take a pile of stuff you want to donate to GoodWill (and bringing you back the receipt for the tax deduction).</li>\n<li>Dropping off laundry, shipping packages, getting things fixed, buying or renting equipment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You get the idea. Basically, your entire Saturday errands just could be outsourced by TaskRabbit. Much of the <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/how-to-stay-productive-during-the-holidays.html" target="_blank">chaos of Christmas</a>  (like finding a tree, and stringing up lights) could be outsourced, too. And it’s a lifesaver for parties.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22750" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/TaskRabbit-1024x717.png" alt="TaskRabbit" width="630" height="441" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/TaskRabbit-300x210.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/TaskRabbit-768x538.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/TaskRabbit-1024x717.png 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/TaskRabbit.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<h2>4) Hire a freelance editor.</h2>\n<p>As this post is written for solopreneurs and other small business owners, I’m going to assume you do some level of content marketing. Maybe you’ve got a blog, for instance. You probably also <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/25-productivity-hacks-email-marketers.html" target="_blank">publish an email newsletter</a>, given the site you’re reading this on.</p>\n<p>If you publish even some content, it’s worth your time to consider hiring an editor. Here’s why:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some studies have found that one typo can <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/education-14130854" target="_blank">cut a website’s online sales <em>in half</em>.</a></li>\n<li>It’s hard for us to see <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/08/wuwt-typos/" target="_blank">our own typos</a>.</li>\n<li>Careful proofreading takes time and focus. As a business owner, you’re already too short on both those things.</li>\n<li>A good editor can make you look even smarter than you are already.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first bullet there alone is reason enough to hire a proofreader/editor. But there’s another powerful time-saving reason to hire one: Blogging.</p>\n<p>As you know all too well, writing blog posts takes time. It’s tempting to want to outsource it, and that does work really well for some companies. But as a solopreneur or a really small business, your expertise is probably the core value of your company. Your expertise needs to be in your blog posts. That’s why I believe that you should be writing – or at least drafting – the content on your site.</p>\n<p>But that doesn’t mean you can’t hire an editor to take a messy first draft and make it into a thing of beauty. <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/2014/06/30/how-to-streamline-your-content-creation/" target="_blank">It’s what Neil Patel does</a>. It’s one of the tricks that lets him write eight blog posts a week.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>5) Website maintenance.</h2>\n<p>If you’re a web designer or developer by trade, you probably don’t need any help with your website. The rest of us do. And even if you do know how to futz with WordPress, there are probably better ways to spend your time – like finding more business.</p>\n<p>Web maintenance can and should be outsourced.</p>\n<p>The trouble is how. Good, reliable web designers/developers, with an understanding of SEO, user experience and conversion, are expensive. And they should be.</p>\n<p>Also, finding and working with a web designer can be time-consuming. Or at least time consuming enough that if you know how to do the basics on your site, you might skip outsourcing this work simply because getting the work done requires so much back and forth.</p>\n<p>There’s a better way. Several companies have popped up that offer unlimited web updates and design services for surprisingly little money. The two I know best are <a href="http://www.undullify.com/" target="_blank">Undullify</a> and <a href="http://designpickle.com/" target="_blank">Design Pickle</a>.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22752" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Undullify-1024x596.jpg" alt="Undullify" width="630" height="366" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Undullify-768x447.jpg 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Undullify-1024x596.jpg 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Undullify.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>Need design support, but you’re not quite ready to hire a designer? Undullify can bridge the gap.</p>\n<p>Undullify is the more affordable of the two. You can get just one design task done for $39, or spend $89 per month for unlimited design tasks with a 3-day turnaround. Their more expensive packages offer faster turnaround times and other benefits. You also get a dedicated designer.</p>\n<p>DesignPickle is much more expensive at $370 per month. If your business is growing fast but you still aren’t quite ready to hire a full-time designer, this might be your solution.</p>\n<p>These services can also help with spiffing up your social media marketing and other promotion efforts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>There is actually a solution to the time versus money dilemma &#8211; at least for people who manage small online businesses. It’s outsourcing. Outsourcing effectively, strategically, and affordably. I hope at least one of the services mentioned here can help you do that better.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think? </strong>Are you outsourcing any small tasks for your business?

The short answer is it can be as little as $5 a day.</p>\n<p>The second thing I clarified was the kinds of <strong>goals</strong> you can set for an ad campaign. It can be brand awareness, sales or lead generation. For our purposes, the latter is what we are focusing on.</p>\n<p>Then I quickly explained how you need to set aside some money to <strong>‘test’ your ad</strong>. This is part of the process. You need to figure out which ads are working and which ones to stop.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I explained how critical it is to nail your opt-in offer and the landing page. The reason is simple, if you can rule out the possibility that it is your freebie offer that is not working, or that your landing page is not converting, you can confidently focus on the rest of the elements of a high converting ad campaign.</p>\n<p>Do check out the first part as it will surely help with setting your Facebook strategy. At the end of the day, you must know why you are doing certain things. You have got to understand the principles and only then you can employ tactics wisely.</p>\n<p>All right, now you are ready to actually start creating the ad. I&#8217;d like to do two more things BEFORE I even open my Facebook. Finish the ad creative.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Write a compelling ad</h2>\n<p>Think about about your newsfeed for a second. You are browsing fast through a bunch of posts, images, videos and links that appear on your timeline. <em>Why</em> do you do this in the first place?</p>\n<p>Well … it might be that you have to kill some time stuck in traffic or waiting for your kids to return from a soccer game. Maybe you are too tired and just want to relax your mind a bit. You want to know if your friend uploaded pics of her recent Bali trip. You may even want to know what’s the latest meme that is going viral.</p>\n<p>When was the last time you opened Facebook thinking you need to find a life coach? When was the last time you said, ‘oh, let me grab my wallet as I may find something I’d like to buy’? Umm &#8211; never.</p>\n<p>You are on Facebook for entertainment, to socialize or even learn something new. You are not looking to buy. Now flip this around. This is the mindset of your ideal audience when they are on Facebook.</p>\n<p>They are tired, busy or distracted. And <strong>their newsfeed is busy</strong>. <strong>You have got to get their attention and get them to click on your ad</strong>. This requires copy that speaks directly to them – words that resonate with them.</p>\n<p>You can’t write like a direct response copywriter on Facebook. You have to work within the context of this social media platform.</p>\n<p><strong>Be conversational.</strong> Use words that your ideal audience would use themselves. <strong>Use interesting images that go well with your ads but also stand out in the newsfeed</strong> (Using a pretty girl in a bikini is not one of them, unless you are selling swimwear. Sure, it will stand out but will it make people click and opt in to what you have to offer? I think not.)</p>\n<p>In order to write copy that gets your ideal audience to click on your ad, you must really know them well in the first place. If you aren’t really sure then you certainly need to work on that first.</p>\n<p><strong>You can borrow some of the words you used on your landing page, for sure</strong>. This is actually a good practice because once they click over and go over to the landing page, it is all very congruent and they feel like they have landed on the right page.</p>\n<p>Your copy can be short or it can be long. This is one of the things you will need to test for yourself. So may run an ad with long copy and another one with short and see which one is getting your cheaper leads.</p>\n<p>Once you are ready with your ad copy, image and the landing page, you can start creating your ad.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Setting up your ad</h2>\n<p>In order to run Facebook ads, you need a personal profile as well as a business page.You can use your ads manager to set up the ad or use power editor, a chrome-extension tool that is more advanced and offers more functionality.</p>\n<p>For example, have you seen those ads where there is a lot of text and you wonder how do they fit in so many extra words? Well, those ads are created in power editor.</p>\n<p>Power editor used to be clunky and hard to navigate but now I find it much easier to use. So I will teach how to set up your ad in there. And once you get the idea, you can easily use your ads manager to do that as well, if necessary.</p>\n<p>The first thing you will need to do is to download power editor. It’s a basically a plugin that works with chrome so you would have to use the chrome browser for your ad creation purposes.</p>\n<p>You can go directly to power editor by clicking <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/manage/powereditor" target="_blank">here</a>. Or, you can also go to your <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/manage" target="_blank">ads manager</a> and you will see it on the top.</p>\n<p>Now the first thing you want to do is put a Facebook pixel on your website. You don’t need to do anything with it now but trust me when I say this, you’ll be kicking yourself down the road if you skip this step. What this pixel does is that it allows you to retarget all your website visitors by creating a website custom audience.</p>\n<p>I strongly recommend that you either find out how you can do this yourself or simply ask someone to do this. Just ask them to place the Facebook pixel between the head tags and you’ll be good to go. Done? Moving on …</p>\n<p>Before we dive into ad creation, I want to talk a bit campaigns, ad sets and ads.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>campaign</strong> lets you choose the objective for your ad, for example website clicks or conversions.</li>\n<li><strong>An ad set</strong> lets you set the budget and schedule of your ad, choose the placement, bidding and the audience.</li>\n<li>And at the <strong>ad</strong> level you create the copy and add the image and the link.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now let’s do this:</p>\n<p>Open the power editor and simply click on the “ + Create Campaign “ button on your top left just under manage ads.</p>\n<p>Once you click there, you will see a box pop up like this:</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22825" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture1-e1455893318724.png" alt="Picture1" width="633" height="677" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture1-e1455893318724-281x300.png 281w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture1-e1455893318724.png 633w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></p>\n<p>Firstly, name your new campaign (leave the buying type set to auction).</p>\n<p>Now you need to select your campaign objective. This is what confuses most people.</p>\n<p>Since our goal is to build your email list, you would choose ‘<strong>website conversions’</strong>.</p>\n<p>Now click on the little box that says choose your ad set, and name a new ad set and do the same for the ad. Keep it simple and click ‘create’.</p>\n<p>Once you have done that, you should be able to see something like this:</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22826" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture2-e1455893301922.png" alt="Picture2" width="633" height="186" /></p>\n<p>For your first ad, you will see 1 on the left. I have run 117 campaigns on my own account so this is what you see here. It shows your campaign’s status to be on but ‘in draft’.</p>\n<p>You don’t need to do anything else with the create campaign, so go ahead and click on the ‘ad set’. This is right under your campaign (121 in this example). Once you click on it and now you are working on the ad set level, click on the <strong>edit box</strong> right next to the ‘ + Create Ad Set ‘.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22827" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture3-e1455893285209.png" alt="Picture3" width="633" height="193" /></p>\n<p>if you hover your mouse over the red error before status, you’ll see that it is asking you to choose a conversion pixel.</p>\n<p>A conversion pixel is just a bit of you code you need to place on the thank you page. This lets Facebook know how many people have hit the thank you page and let you know the number of conversions and the cost per conversion.</p>\n<p>This is super important. If you don’t place the conversion pixel, you have no idea of how many people are opting in and how much are you paying for subscriber.</p>\n<p>Facebook has recently changed their pixels and introduced a new Facebook pixel. Teaching you how to choose a pixel to track your conversions is outside the scope of this post but I’ll be sure to cover this in another post.</p>\n<p>You could simply ask someone to do it for you or Google and learn to do it yourself.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22828" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture4-e1455893270438.png" alt="Picture4" width="633" height="471" /></p>\n<p>Let’s say you have already set up a conversion pixel. Click in the box that says ‘Choose a conversion event’ and your pixel should pop up. Just select it and the red error will disappear.</p>\n<p>Next set your daily budget, in our case $10.</p>\n<p>Under schedule, either schedule or select run as ongoing. I recommend starting your ads in the morning because Facebook uses the daily budget not for a period of 24 hours, but for the remaining hours in that dy. So if you started at 7pm, it would use up $10 by midnight.</p>\n<p>When you scroll down, you’ll be prompted to select the audience and the placement of your ad.</p>\n<p>Now targeting of your ad is SUPER CRITICAL and is a HUGE topic in itself. Who to target and how big your audience size needs to be are the two questions that will get you a million different answers.</p>\n<p>If you are choosing to spend $10 a day, I’d recommend an audience size of 100K to 200K. This works well for me for this budget.</p>\n<p>And I also recommend interest targeting, meaning targeting pages of your competitors and people in the same space as you. You can do that by clicking on ‘edit audience’, choosing the countries you want to target, the demographics and when finally plugging in different pages to see what comes up. Then choose a page. Don’t forget to save your audience for your next ad.</p>\n<p>I recommend testing with one audience per campaign just to keep things simple.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22829" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture5-e1455893256357.png" alt="Picture5" width="633" height="516" /></p>\n<p>For placement, I usually do newsfeed but you can click more placements like desktop newsfeed and desktop sidebar.</p>\n<p>And when you scroll down further, the last thing is the pricing.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22830" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture6-e1455893233450.png" alt="Picture6" width="633" height="402" /></p>\n<p>Click on automatic so Facebook can optimize the ad delivery for you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The ad</h2>\n<p>Choose the box under the ad set on your far left and click on <strong>edit</strong> right next to ‘ + Create Ad’.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22831" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture7-e1455893215309.png" alt="Picture7" width="633" height="250" /></p>\n<p>Once you click the edit button, a new box will pop up.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22832" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Picture8-e1455893193616.png" alt="Picture8" width="633" height="326" /></p>\n<p>The first thing you need to do is select your page. You see mine in this example.</p>\n<p>Next, choose the ‘ad with an image or video’ option and put in the name of the URL you will be sending traffic to. This is the landing page where people will sign up.</p>\n<p>Now this is my most favorite part of using power editor. See where it says ‘Text’, here you can write as much as you like. This is what appears just above the image.

Organic reach became the goal.<span id="more-22781"></span></p>\n<p>Organic reach fell off around 2014, when Facebook did its famous switcheroo and knocked organic reach down to single digits for most publishers. Now, two years later, most smart marketers have zeroed in on engagement rates – the measurement of how many likes, shares and comments each post gets.</p>\n<p>Obviously, engagement matters because it means your audience is interacting with your content. That keeps your company top of mind, so your followers are more likely to think of you when they need your services.</p>\n<p>But that’s not the only benefit of a high engagement rate. You see, Facebook views engagement rates as a strong signal that your posts have value. It’s not the only signal, but it’s an important one. So the higher your engagement rates go, the more likely it is that your <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/facebooks-new-organic-post-targeting-new-tools.html" target="_blank">page’s organic reach</a> will rise, too. It’s a double win.</p>\n<p>To help you get more engagement for everything you publish on the biggest social network, we’ve rounded up some recent research on what works best for improving engagement rates on Facebook. All the data here is less than six months old.</p>\n<p>I hope when you finish this article you’ll have picked up several tips to get more mileage out of everything you publish on Facebook. Best of all, none of these tactics costs any money. None of them require advanced Facebook skills. They’re just simple hacks proven to get you more results.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>What an analysis of 1 billion Facebook posts revealed</h2>\n<p>Let’s start with the biggest study first. Earlier this month, the folks over at BuzzSumo published another one of their massive <a href="http://buzzsumo.com/blog/how-to-improve-facebook-engagement-insights-from-1bn-posts/" target="_blank">research projects</a> – an analysis of over <strong>a billion</strong> Facebook posts across 30 million brand pages. If that isn’t a big enough pool of data to draw from, I don’t know what is.</p>\n<p>Here’s the summary of what they found, with the charts to back it up:</p>\n<h3>1) The best time to post is between 10 PM and midnight in your audience’s local time.</h3>\n<p>That’s the official information from BuzzSumo, but when you look at the graph of their data, you can see there’s a bit more to the story</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22785" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookBestTime.png" alt="BuzzSumoFacebookBestTime" width="630" height="383" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookBestTime-768x467.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookBestTime-1024x623.png 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookBestTime.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>It’s not that 10pm and midnight aren’t good times – they most certainly are. But the entire time slot from 7 pm to 1 am does better than average (that’s the section between the two blue lines).</p>\n<p>Any time within those hours is a good time to post, and actually, even an hour before and after the two blue lines would perform a bit better than average. The results spike even higher if we look at the very peak of the <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/10-data-based-tips-for-better-facebook-engagement.html" target="_blank">engagement rates</a>, from 8 pm until about 11 pm. 10 pm – the highest spot on the chart – is the very best time to post.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>2) The best day to post is Sunday.</h3>\n<p>And Saturday posts do nearly as well. So why are weekends such good times to post? Competition. Fewer posts overall are published on weekends, so you’re competing with fewer posts for your audience’s attention.</p>\n<p>We just saw this same phenomenon in the chart above. There, posts published later in the day performed better because fewer posts get published later in the day… and thus, there’s less competition.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22786" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookDayOfWeek.png" alt="BuzzSumoFacebookDayOfWeek" width="630" height="368" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookDayOfWeek-300x175.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookDayOfWeek-768x448.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookDayOfWeek-1024x597.png 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookDayOfWeek.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>This same principle applies to email marketing, and pretty much every other publishing platform. It’s best to publish when other companies are mostly quiet. Even if you’ll reach fewer members of your audience, the lift you’ll get from the <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/everything-you-need-to-know-to-spy-on-your-competition.html" target="_blank">reduced competition</a> will more than make up the difference.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>3) Question and image-based posts get the most engagement.</h3>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22787" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookPostType.png" alt="BuzzSumoFacebookPostType" width="630" height="417" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookPostType-300x199.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookPostType-768x509.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookPostType-1024x678.png 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookPostType.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>The BuzzSumo data actually saw even higher engagement rates than what you see here. The higher rates were specifically for posts that used an image <em>and</em> a question together. If you can come up with a few posts like that, it would be interesting to see if you can duplicate these results. Try a couple variations to see what works best for your audience.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example of a question and image post from the clothing retailer LL Bean:</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22788" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/QuestionPostLLBean.jpg" alt="QuestionPostLLBean" width="630" height="631" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/QuestionPostLLBean-150x150.jpg 150w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/QuestionPostLLBean-300x300.jpg 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/QuestionPostLLBean-768x769.jpg 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/QuestionPostLLBean-1022x1024.jpg 1022w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/QuestionPostLLBean-1078x1080.jpg 1078w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/QuestionPostLLBean.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>And another one from Mellow Mushroom, a pizza chain out of Atlanta, Georgia:</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22789" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/MellowMushroom.jpg" alt="MellowMushroom" width="630" height="601" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/MellowMushroom-300x286.jpg 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/MellowMushroom-768x732.jpg 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/MellowMushroom-1024x976.jpg 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/MellowMushroom-1133x1080.jpg 1133w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/MellowMushroom.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>One more thing about this chart &#8211; about how poorly coupons and discounts did. If you’ve been trying to get <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/email-marketers-secret-weapon-digital-coupons.html" target="_blank">more engagement via coupons</a>, discounts and giveaways, this study suggests it might be time to stop. But I’m not entirely sure about that. There’s a lot of data that shows people follow brands and businesses on social media to get exactly those kinds of perks.</p>\n<p>Here’s a recent chart from <a href="https://www.marketingsherpa.com/article/chart/why-customers-follow-brands-social-accounts" target="_blank">MarketingSherpa</a> showing exactly that:</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22790" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/chartofweek-111715-lp.png" alt="chartofweek-111715-lp" width="630" height="488" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/chartofweek-111715-lp-300x232.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/chartofweek-111715-lp.png 704w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>I’m not entirely sure how to reconcile these two pieces of data. I trust what BuzzSumo found, but there’s several surveys showing how people want discounts and coupons.</p>\n<p>Could it be that some company pages are just offering too many discounts, and people are getting numb to them (lookin’ at you, GlassesUSA). Or is something else going on here?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>4) Short text posts with less than 50 characters get the highest interaction rates.</h3>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22791" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookPostLength.png" alt="BuzzSumoFacebookPostLength" width="630" height="396" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookPostLength-300x189.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookPostLength-768x483.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookPostLength-1024x644.png 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookPostLength.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>There’s been a slew of studies supporting this finding. Shorter posts have consistently outperformed longer posts for years. One study I found dated all the way back to 2012. It was on Jeff Bullas’ blog, and showed <a href="http://www.jeffbullas.com/2012/02/29/10-powerful-tips-to-increase-fan-engagement-on-facebook/" target="_blank">similar results</a> for several of BuzzSumo’s findings.</p>\n<p>Back then, Jeff found the sweet spot to be posts with 40 characters. Those got 86% more engagement, though any post with less than 80 characters did well.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22792" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Keep-Facebook-posts-short.jpg" alt="Keep-Facebook-posts-short" width="630" height="445" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Keep-Facebook-posts-short-300x212.jpg 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Keep-Facebook-posts-short-768x543.jpg 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Keep-Facebook-posts-short.jpg 787w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<h3>5) Posts that link to long-form content (articles of 1,000-3,000 words or more) get more engagement than posts that link to shorter content.</h3>\n<p>This is interesting, because one of the biggest reasons for any company to be on Facebook is to get additional traffic. And boy, can Facebook deliver. <a href="http://blog.parsely.com/post/2855/facebook-continues-to-beat-google-in-sending-traffic-to-top-publishers/" target="_blank">Research from Parse.ly</a> shows Facebook actually beating even Google when it comes to driving traffic to websites. If you’re doing content marketing, you could justify a Facebook presence purely to get a slice of that traffic.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22793" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Top-Traffic-Referrals-Sources.png" alt="Top-Traffic-Referrals-Sources" width="630" height="298" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Top-Traffic-Referrals-Sources-300x142.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Top-Traffic-Referrals-Sources-768x363.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Top-Traffic-Referrals-Sources.png 1017w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<h3>6) Native Facebook videos get more than six times the engagement than YouTube embedded videos.</h3>\n<p>This isn’t the only research study to discover that “native” Facebook videos crush embedded YouTube videos. We <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/use-facebooks-new-video-features.html" target="_blank">wrote about it</a> ourselves a couple of months back.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22794" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookVideos.png" alt="BuzzSumoFacebookVideos" width="630" height="437" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookVideos-300x208.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookVideos-768x532.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookVideos-1024x710.png 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookVideos.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<h3>7) Images posted to Instagram and then shared on Facebook get 23% more engagement.</h3>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22795" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookInstagram.png" alt="BuzzSumoFacebookInstagram" width="630" height="439" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookInstagram-300x209.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookInstagram-768x535.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookInstagram-1024x713.png 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzSumoFacebookInstagram.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>If you haven’t <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/the-abcs-of-instagram.html" target="_blank">gotten started on Instagram</a> yet, this should be a pretty strong motivator. And because Instagram is owned by Facebook, I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw both Facebook and Instagram reward activity on either platform. In other words, I bet we’ll see more evidence of Instagram activity helping Facebook results, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>8) Posts without hashtags tend to do better than posts with hashtags.</h3>\n<p>Uh-oh. If you’ve been posting the same social media updates to Twitter, Google+ and Facebook, it’s time to rethink your strategy. Facebook isn’t anywhere near as <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/complete-guide-using-hashtags.html" target="_blank">hashtag friendly</a> as Twitter (or even Instagram) is. So take the extra time to format your Facebook posts specifically for Facebook. No more cheating and just publishing the same update to all your social accounts.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22796" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzsumoFacebookHashtags.png" alt="BuzzsumoFacebookHashtags" width="630" height="413" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzsumoFacebookHashtags-300x197.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzsumoFacebookHashtags-768x504.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzsumoFacebookHashtags-1024x672.png 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BuzzsumoFacebookHashtags.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>But what about your audience?</h2>\n<p>As this data is great, but it has one major shortcoming.

I’m going to give you the step-by-step so you are able to dive into the world of Facebook ads with confidence.<span id="more-22800"></span></p>\n<p>If you are already using Facebook ads as part of your overall marketing strategy, you might feel tempted to skip over this article – don’t.</p>\n<p>If you are like most people who are using Facebook ads, your goal might be to reduce your cost per lead (and I’ll explain the commonly used terms in a minute for the complete newbies, so stay with me here) or you might be actively looking to find insights that will help you get a better ROI on your ads. So check out these two posts anyway.</p>\n<p>Let’s get stuck into it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Your budget</h2>\n<p>The number one question that people ask when it comes to Facebook advertising is how much money do you need? Do you need thousands of dollars to start with or can you start with really low amounts?</p>\n<p>You may even wonder if you should consider Facebook ads because you don’t have a big budget to assign to Facebook ads.</p>\n<p>So this is the thing: you can run Facebook ads for as low as $5 per day. You can stop your ad any time you time. So for example, you may start an ad on $10 per day and run it for a week, just to test the water. You will end up spending $70 (and no more, you can rest assured that Facebook will only spend the amount you allocated). You could do less, you could more. It just depends on you budget and comfort level. Clear? Good.</p>\n<p>The second most frequently asked question is how much should you be paying per lead (or for someone to join your list).</p>\n<p>Well, nobody can tell you this, however there are industry guidelines. <strong>On average, you can pay between $1- $5 for every person opting in to your list.</strong></p>\n<p>Usually, you pay less for somebody opting in to a quick lead magnet (your opt-in offer) and more for a webinar registrant or to get somebody to get on a sales call with you. So if you do a quick calculation, you can work out that you can get 5 high quality leads daily on a $10 budget assuming you cost per lead is $2.</p>\n<p>Another thing to consider while assigning determining your Facebook budget is to think about whether you would like to hire somebody to run your ads for you. In that case, it will be your ad spend plus their fee on top of it.</p>\n<p>In this post though, we are trying to eliminate the ‘outsourcing’ option so you can do this yourself until such time you are ready to invest in an ad expert.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Your purpose</h2>\n<p>When it comes to running Facebook ads, you can choose a couple of things to shoot for. You can run ads to <strong>build brand awareness</strong> and increase the number of likes on your Facebook page. You can promote your Facebook posts to do the same.</p>\n<p>You can also run ads and send people <strong>straight to a sales page</strong> or an ecommerce store. While this can work for some people, I don’t recommend this approach. You have got to understand that Facebook is primarily a social platform. People don’t open their Facebook with their wallets in their hand, which they may do when they are going on Amazon, Ebay or even Google because they have a buying intention. On Facebook, somebody might buy something as a low-dollar impulse-buy like a T-shirt, but its very unlikely they will make a bigger investment especially when they don’t know you.</p>\n<p>You can run ads specially for the purposes of <strong>lead generation</strong>. So your goal would be to build your email list. This is what we will be focusing on this post.</p>\n<p>You can also run ads to <strong>retarget people</strong>. This means you run ads specifically to whose who are either on your email list already, who have visited your website recently or those who clicked on an old. These strategies work like gangbusters, however, for those who are new the world of Facebook ads, they are not totally relevant right this minute.</p>\n<p>Your list is super small so I’d rather have you focus on lead generation than retargeting. As you move forward and gain confidence as well as people on your list, you can then start looking into retargeting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The testing phase</h2>\n<p>Before I move any further and begin teaching you the process, I must make one thing super clear. This is one of those things that nobody is telling you and might lead to tears, frustration and disappointment.</p>\n<p>Firstly, people say that you can run Facebook ads for $5 or $10 a day, they are telling the truth. But what they are not saying is that you may NOT see any results from this ad spend. At least initially.</p>\n<p>So what do I mean by that? When you are new to Facebook ads, or a seasoned pro for that matter, any time you start a new Facebook campaign, you are not going to see the results right off the bat. Meaning, <strong>when you start running ads, you may or may not get the leads at the price you are willing to pay for them</strong>.</p>\n<p>This phase is often called ‘testing’. Here you are essentially playing with your targeting, your ad creative (copy, image, call to action, etc.) and the landing page you are sending traffic to. You might be running many different variations of the same ad targeting a different audience, or a same audience with a different copy or ad or what not. There are a million different ways to do this.</p>\n<p>Usually you need to set aside a couple of hundred dollars just to test your ad/audience. When you know what’s working then you can do your $10 per day ad and get $2 leads (opt-ins). You won’t get $2 leads from day 1 but you will.</p>\n<p>So when people complain that ads don’t work, or that they lost hundreds of dollars in ads, they are basically stuck in the testing phase. They are stuck and they can’t get out because they don’t know what they are doing.</p>\n<p>We are going to fix them by teaching you exactly when you need to focus on and what you can safely ignore.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Choose your lead magnet</h2>\n<p>If you can, I’d like you to begin creating your Facebook ad using a <strong>lead magnet this is already working for you</strong>. I want you to choose something that is PROVEN.</p>\n<p>This way you can start on the right foot. You can be confident knowing that you get a conversion on your lead magnet so you don’t need to worry about whether it is your opt-in itself that needs to be changed hence reducing one variable.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have a lead magnet, what I can tell you that on Facebook, freebies that can be consumed quickly work REALLY well.</p>\n<p>Think about it for a second. What was the last time you downloaded an ebook after clicking somebody’s ad and then sat and read it? I’m guessing, never. Most people don’t read large documents they download. They save it for some day and as we all know, that day doesn’t exist.</p>\n<p>You want to attract your perfect audience with the right lead magnet but you also want them to consume it. Sure, a percentage of people will never ever download your thing but that’s a very small percentage.</p>\n<p>Lead magnets that work really well are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cheat sheets</li>\n<li>Checklist</li>\n<li>List of tools</li>\n<li>List of resources</li>\n<li>A short case study</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other magnets that work but cost more</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Webinar registrations</li>\n<li>One on one discovery calls</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And more opt-ins that work also depending upon your niche and target audience</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Daily challenge</li>\n<li>Video series</li>\n<li>Webinar replay</li>\n<li>PDF report</li>\n<li>Email course</li>\n<li>Ebook</li>\n<li>White paper</li>\n<li>Free trial</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have something that is working, use that. If you want to create something, try creating a quick cheat sheet or a checklist. They have a high desire and high perceived value. People know they don’t need to sit through a long piece of document or a 50-min long video to get a few nuggets.</p>\n<p>It’s worth saying that a quality lead magnet is specific, addresses ONE thing that your ideal audience finds challenging and gives them a quick win. Keep that in mind when you are creating it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Nail your landing page</h2>\n<p>The second most important piece of the puzzle you want to nail is your landing page. When you are getting clicks on your ad but people are not opting in, your landing page is the culprit.</p>\n<p>Your landing page should convert 20% at MINIMUM for your Facebook ads to work. Anything above that you should be happy with. When you become pro at getting clicks on your landing page, you can play with your landing page to increase your conversions for 20% is what you must be getting.</p>\n<p>Assuming you are sending traffic to a page prompting people to hand over their email address in exchange for a cheat sheet. Your landing page must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call your audience out. Somebody is your ideal target audience must identify with your copy and feel like they are in the right place.</li>\n<li>Clearly spell out the benefits of signing up. The easiest way to accomplish that is to list them as bullet points and tease out those benefits.</li>\n<li>Clear call to action. Give them a place to put their name and email in. Make sure you don’t say things like ‘instant download’. Tell people the cheat sheet will be sent to the email they provide to discourage freebie seekers and those who put fake email addresses. If they are serious, they need to give you an email they check often.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another thing that is super important to note is that <strong>your landing page should be congruent to your Facebook ad</strong>. Meaning, it should match the colours, fonts and the copy you used in the ad.</p>\n<p>For example, if you use primarily red in your ad, use the same colour on your landing page as well. If you call it a ‘cheat sheet’, don’t refer to it as a ‘checklist’. Make people confident that they have landed on a right page and not on something completely different. This tip will do wonders for your conversion rate.</p>\n<p>There are many different tools to create these landing pages. You can use the page provided by your email service, <a href="http://www.getresponse.com/features/landing-page-creator.html" target="_blank">GetResponse landing pages</a>, for example, or you can use third party tools such as Leadpages, Instapage, Thrive or Click Funnels. Some tools have additional functionality such as creating WordPress websites or sales funnels.</p>\n<p>Alright, when you have your lead magnet, your landing page ready, you are in a good place to actually start working on your Facebook ad.</p>\n<p>From this point onwards, things will become a bit technical so I’ll be sure to include screenshots to guide you through the process, however know that when you are clear on your goal, have the perfect opt-in offer and a highly congruent, high converting landing page, you are already in a very good place.</p>\n<p>In part-two of this Facebook ad series, I’ll teach you how to use power editor to create your ad, how to do some basic testing, how to choose the right image (super important), put the right words in your ad (copy) and get as many clicks as you can to drive the cost down.</p>\n<p>Can’t wait to teach this!</p>\n\n<div class="wp_rp_wrap  wp_rp_plain" ><div class="wp_rp_content"><h3 class="related_post_title">Related posts</h3><ul class="related_post wp_rp"><li data-position="0" data-poid="in-22807" data-post-type="none" ><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/how-to-run-a-facebook-ad-and-build-your-list-for-10-a-day-part-ii.html" class="wp_rp_thumbnail"><img width="150" height="150" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/pexels-photo-24266-large-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-0x0 size-0x0 wp-post-image" alt="pexels-photo-24266-large" /></a><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/how-to-run-a-facebook-ad-and-build-your-list-for-10-a-day-part-ii.html" class="wp_rp_title">How to Run a Facebook Ad and Build Your List for $10 a Day (Part II)</a></li><li data-position="1" data-poid="in-6513" data-post-type="none" ><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/how-to-use-facebook-to-build-your-email-list.html" class="wp_rp_thumbnail"><img width="150" height="150" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2015/12/bow-tie-sunglasses-apple-iphone-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-0x0 size-0x0 wp-post-image" alt="bow-tie-sunglasses-apple-iphone" /></a><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/how-to-use-facebook-to-build-your-email-list.html" class="wp_rp_title">How to Use Facebook to Build Your Email List</a></li></ul></div></div>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.getresponse.com/how-to-run-a-facebook-ad-and-build-your-list-for-10-a-day-part-i.html">How to Run a Facebook Ad and Build Your List for $10 a Day (Part I)</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.getresponse.com">GetResponse Blog - Email Marketing Tips</a>.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"http://blog.getresponse.com/how-to-run-a-facebook-ad-and-build-your-list-for-10-a-day-part-i.html/feed";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:42:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"New Research on What Really Works for Improving Productivity";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"http://blog.getresponse.com/new-research-on-what-really-works-for-improving-productivity.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:101:"http://blog.getresponse.com/new-research-on-what-really-works-for-improving-productivity.html#respond";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 14:17:42 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"PRODUCTIVITY";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"http://blog.getresponse.com/?p=22736";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:653:"<p>Whether it’s a technique for how to set priorities or tricks for managing your inbox, there’s no shortage of ideas for how to better spend your time.

I can’t promise any of these productivity tips will be your magic solution, but these <em>are</em> all data-driven.</p>\n<p>They also all make practical sense, and they support many of the other productivity tips you’ve been hearing for so long. Most of them will appeal to your intuition, too. For example, you always thought you worked better by a window. Now you’ll know why.</p>\n<p>Actual scientists from major universities and research centers did the studies summarized here. They drew their conclusions based on statistically valid sample sizes. That doesn’t necessarily mean these productivity tips are really any better than any other ones. But hopefully a couple of them will stick, and you’ll get that extra little edge you need.</p>\n<p>I specifically picked productivity tips for “knowledge workers” – people who tend to work at a desk, in an office, with other coworkers near them. All these tips actually focus on improving your workspace. They don’t require any special equipment or conditions. But they should help you get far more work done, and be happier, too.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Turn your phone off</h2>\n<p>Having your phone beep, chirp and buzz while you work is distracting &#8211; even if you never touch your phone. Just hearing the notification blunts your focus. It also sets you up to make three to four times as many mistakes.</p>\n<p>That’s according to a <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/07/just-hearing-your-phone-buzz-hurts-your-productivity" target="_blank">study</a> from Florida State University done by Cary Stothart, Ainsley Mitchum, and Courtney Yehnert. The researchers noticed how the notifications from their own cell phones kept disrupting their focus. So they decided to run an experiment to verify if cell phone activity – even when we don’t respond to it &#8211; affects how people complete tasks.</p>\n<p>The research team rounded up 212 university students, asking each one of them for their phone number, email address, and other information. Then they asked them to do a fairly simple task for 10 minutes. The task was specifically designed to test how well the students could focus. To complete it, they just had to press a key any time a number showed up on their computer screen – unless that number was 3. Then they weren’t supposed to press the key. (Gotta keep it interesting, right?)</p>\n<p>After ten minutes of this, the students got a 1-minute break. Then they started another 10-minute block of number checking. That’s when the notifications started.</p>\n<p>A computer randomly broke the students into three groups – one that got phone calls, one that got text messages, and one that got no notifications. As the notifications went out, the researchers watched for who actually stopped the task and interacted with their phone. Anyone who picked up their phone was not included in the study results. The researchers only wanted to include people who got the notifications but ignored them.</p>\n<p>So how did the different groups do?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The students who got phone call notifications made 28% more mistakes.</li>\n<li>The students who got text message notifications made 23% more mistakes.</li>\n<li>The people who got no notifications made 7% more mistakes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why 7% more mistakes from people who didn’t get any notifications? Fatigue. The longer we work, the more likely we are to make mistakes. More about this in a moment.</p>\n<p>There wasn’t any statistically valid difference in mistakes made between the people who got phone calls or texts. But there was definitely a statistically valid increase for the people who got notifications versus those who got none.</p>\n<p>So there you have it. Next time you’ve got a detail-oriented task that requires a lot of focus, ditch your phone. Keeping it with you – even if you ignore it – will cause you to make 3-4 times more mistakes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Consider wearing headphones and listening to natural sounds</h2>\n<p>If the idea of no noise and no cellphone makes you uncomfortable, I have a suggestion: Listen to natural sounds as background music. You know, sounds like rain, wind through leaves, a campfire… even a distant thunderstorm.</p>\n<p>This works best if you use the natural sounds like white noise – to muffle the noise from general office activity. The background sound of a typical office makes it harder for many employees to focus. That’s why some companies actually play “white noise” in their offices.</p>\n<p>Ends up, they might do better playing natural sounds instead. That’s what a <a href="http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/137/4/10.1121/1.4920363" target="_blank">study released last year</a> from The Acoustical Society of America suggests. They found that sound masking systems that play natural sounds affect workers far more positively than traditional white noise. The natural sounds improve cognitive function and the ability to concentrate. They also boost overall worker satisfaction.</p>\n<p>If you can’t get your entire office to switch over, don’t worry. There are plenty of good options to create natural sounds in your own space.</p>\n<p>First, there are apps. Try <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rain-rain-sleep-sounds/id478687481?mt=8" target="_blank">Rain, Rain Sleep Sounds</a> if you’ve got an iOS device . For Android users, there’s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zodinplex.naturesound&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Nature Sounds Relax and Sleep</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to avoid using your phone entirely, try this website: <a href="http://www.noisli.com/" target="_blank">Noisli</a>. It’s free and has plenty of background noises to choose from. My favorite is the crickets.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22739" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Noisli-1024x809.png" alt="Noisli" width="630" height="498" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Noisli-300x237.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Noisli-768x607.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Noisli-1024x809.png 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Noisli.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>Noisli is a free website that lets you choose from a number of natural sounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sit near a slightly open window and buy a plant<strong> </strong></h2>\n<p>Or better yet, improve the ventilation system at your workspace. Or not. Unfortunately, most of us probably can’t get our bosses to install a new ventilation system. So sitting near a slightly opened window may be the next best thing.</p>\n<p>Here’s why you want the window in the first place: According to researchers at Harvard University and SUNY Upstate Medical, doubling the ventilation in offices can result in up to $6,500 in increased productivity per employee per year. The researchers estimate it would cost between $14- $40 per employee to get the ventilation improvements needed for the productivity boost.</p>\n<p><strong>Even at a cost of $40 per employee, that works out to a 16150% ROI. </strong><strong>Wow.</strong></p>\n<p>This wasn’t just one isolated test, either. <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-research-quantifies-value-of-increased-productivity-from-improved-indoor-air-quality-300181023.html" target="_blank">The study</a> was run in seven different U.S. states, with three different types of indoor environments and four different ventilation (HVAC) systems.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22740" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/VentilationForProductivity.jpg" alt="VentilationForProductivity" width="630" height="776" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/VentilationForProductivity-768x947.jpg 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/VentilationForProductivity.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>Why the plant? <a href="http://lifehacker.com/this-graphic-shows-the-best-air-cleaning-plants-accord-1705307836" target="_blank">According to NASA</a>, plants significantly improve air quality. So if you can’t get near a window or can’t get near an open window, a plant might help you breathe better. And thus work better.</p>\n<p>But wait, there’s more: Sitting near the window may boost your productivity in other ways, too. Even if the window is closed. Several studies (like <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24932139" target="_blank">this one</a> and <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/01/enlightened-minds.aspx" target="_blank">this one</a>) done in the last few years show that natural daylight or bright artificial light with a blue hue can help us sleep more soundly, and perform our work more efficiently.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22741" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/SleepQuality-630x1024.png" alt="SleepQuality" width="630" height="1024" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/SleepQuality-630x1024.png 630w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/SleepQuality-664x1080.png 664w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/SleepQuality.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<h2>Take a break</h2>\n<p>Feel like you need a break sometimes? You do. It might even help you get more work done.</p>\n<p>That’s what a study by Emily M. Hunter and Cindy Wu found. In <em><a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2015-36861-001" target="_blank">Give Me a Better Break: Choosing Workday Break Activities to Maximize Resource Recovery</a></em>, Hunter and Wu outline how longer, more frequent breaks can boost productivity more than shorter, less frequent breaks will.</p>\n<p>Hunter and Wu studied 95 employees. They looked at how those employees responded to breaks of different lengths at different times across a five day workweek. Not only did longer breaks boost employees’ productivity more than short ones, but breaks taken earlier helped more than breaks taken after employees had been working for several hours non-stop.</p>\n<p>Key takeaway: It’s just like you suspected. You do your best work when you’re fresh. And you get more work done if you stay fresh. What’s more, once you’re feeling a bit burned out, even a long break won’t help you as much as if you’d had a break earlier, before you got worn out.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Here’s the key takeaways of each of these studies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Even if you ignore it, a buzzing phone is still a distraction.</li>\n<li>Natural sounds are better for noise masking than traditional white noise.</li>\n<li>Fresher air boosts cognitive function. That allows us to make better, faster decisions that result in higher productivity.</li>\n<li>Exposure to natural light will help you sleep deeper, and thus feel sharper during the day.</li>\n<li>Long, frequent breaks help you work more efficiently. Especially if you take them before you start to feel worn out.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What do you think? </strong>How do these studies line up with your personal experience?

Indeed, is an <em>extremely </em>popular information source on the web. It enjoys almost obscene amounts of traffic, and dedicated users of the site are just that <em>– dedicated</em>. Not to mention committed and often evangelical to boot.</p>\n<p>Here are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/about/" target="_blank">some stats</a> to prove it to you:</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22774" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Reddit_stats.png" alt="Reddit_stats" width="630" height="177" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Reddit_stats-300x84.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Reddit_stats-768x215.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Reddit_stats.png 938w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<h2>What Is Reddit?</h2>\n<p>Ok, so we can see that it’s popular. And anything that’s popular we should really pay heed to, for we are marketing professionals who are always looking for new channels to promote our respective brands, right? Right.</p>\n<p>But what is Reddit?</p>\n<p>This is a good question, actually, for, as popular as the site is, it nonetheless has a (not wholly unjust) reputation for being complicated and/or difficult, and, as such, this can be (quite naturally) off-putting, especially for newbies.</p>\n<p>It’s not like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest (well, perhaps it is a <em>bit</em> like Pinterest), Instagram, or any of the other networks that dominate most our time. It <em>is</em> a social network (of sorts), but the “social” side is strictly refined to comments on links that users upload. That is to say that Reddit is most certainly not another Facebook where we post pictures of what we did last night, nor is it another Twitter where we send out our witty quips about the latest trending topic. And neither is it a professional network, like LinkedIn, nor is it a marketing site (like Pinterest, say) where users essentially browse through links deciding what to buy.</p>\n<p>No, Reddit is none of these things.</p>\n<p>Reddit is an aggregator site. That is to say that on Reddit, users submit links to <em>other</em> sites. As such, some people tend to think of it as a news website – for most of the links that are submitted tend to point towards the latest news articles.</p>\n<p>The social aspect comes in through the comments section. Beneath each link, other users can comment on and up-vote content. The hottest stories rise to the top of the page, whilst the ones that aren’t generating much interest sink down.</p>\n<p>Essentially, it’s an online bulletin board system. Or, to think of it more proverbially, it’s like the water cooler at the office, or the back of canteen at school – it’s where the cool kids go to decide what’s hot and what’s not in the world of online interactions.</p>\n<p>Writing last year, world-renowned social media blogger <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/2015/06/18/how-to-get-your-slice-of-reddits-150-million-pageviews/" target="_blank">Neil Patel wrote this</a> about the site:</p>\n<p>“The most interesting part of Reddit is that it’s different from the majority of large sites. Most other sites are strictly controlled by a team of moderators or editors. Reddit, on the other hand, is controlled by its users.</p>\n<p>I believe that Reddit is the finest example of <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/01/permission-mark.html" target="_blank">permission marketing</a> working on a large scale. In case you’re unfamiliar with it, permission marketing was the term coined by Seth Godin several years ago:</p>\n<p><em>‘Permission doesn’t have to be a one-way broadcast medium. The internet means you can treat different people differently, and it demands that you figure out how to let your permission base choose what they hear and in what format.’”</em><em> </em></p>\n<p>You can see why, with explanations like that, that some people write the site off as being too complicated from the outset.</p>\n<p>But we will not be deterred…</p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<h2>Reddit: The Fundamentals</h2>\n<p>Ok, let’s break things down into easily digestible chunks so we can see how we’d go about using Reddit for marketing.</p>\n<h3>Subreddits</h3>\n<p>In Reddit terms, a subreddit is a topic-based community on Reddit. Each subreddit is simply a place where users (called redditors) can submit and discuss content that is centred on a certain topic – social media marketing, for example. Redditors can subscribe to subreddits that are related to things that they’re interested in to keep up with all the goss.</p>\n<p>It’s absolutely imperative that you get to grips with subreddits if want to start marketing on Reddit. Each and every single subreddit is its very own self-contained community, with its own set of rules, redditquette, culture and demographic. That is to say that the wider Reddit usership will probably not have much interest in your brand – and may well indeed become extremely (digitally) vocal if you start trying to market your wares here there and everywhere on the site – there most likely be a specific subreddit where you will be most welcomed by fans who want to hear exactly what you have to say.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Link Posts</h3>\n<p>Redditors can submit links to a subreddit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Text/Self Posts</h3>\n<p>Or they can submit text posts – which are literally just like a blog post. Text posts are often called “self posts” because they link to themselves as opposed to an external web page.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Voting</h2>\n<p>Ok, here’s where Seth Godin’s “permission marketing” really shows itself. Redditors can cast a vote upon every post <em>and </em>comment on Reddit.</p>\n<p>Every posts that appears on Reddit is given a score, and redditors can either “upvote” or “downvote” the posts. The score which is displayed is the collective difference between all up and downvotes. This means that if 10 posts are submitted at exactly the same time, they will be ranked in order of which has the better the score – the higher scores appearing above the lower ones on the page.</p>\n<p>So, users literally have control over what appears on the front page of Reddit at any given time. But it also means that content creators can get a real-time feel for what type of content is well-received, and what isn’t.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22776" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/upvote.gif" alt="upvote" width="320" height="320" /></p>\n<h6>(Image Source: <a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/bill-murray-upvote-hLPNDUZ3ntKEM" target="_blank">Giphy</a>)</h6>\n<h2>Moderators</h2>\n<p>Subreddits really are communities, and each community has its own leader or leaders. These are known as moderators, and take it upon themselves to control the content that gets uploaded to the subreddit. Ideally, they will be trying to maintain the spirit and rules of the subreddit – which, almost invariably, means no promos.</p>\n<p>Moderators have the power to remove content and even ban users who don’t fall within the rules – so don’t chance your luck on Reddit, the user base knows what it wants and likes what it likes. However, you are encouraged to “message the moderators” if you have a question as to what type of content they may accept.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Redditquette For Marketers</h2>\n<p>Ok, there is a redditquette for <em>all</em> users of Reddit, but we just need, for the purposes of this blog at least, to concentrate on what Reddit etiquette (or redditquette) for marketers means. Indeed, this is the most important thing that you will need to understand if you want to maintain a successful marketing presence on Reddit.</p>\n<p>Firstly, read the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette" target="_blank">overview on redditquette</a> on the Reddit website itself – this will help you to understand generally the rules regarding behaviour on the site. However, each subreddit has its very own redditquette – so you will need to read these guidelines <em>as well</em> before posting anything (and it won’t hurt to read the redditquette again every once in a while, just to keep yourself refreshed).</p>\n<p>Aside from reading up on and adhering to the rules of each subreddit, you will do well to understand from the outset what the Reddit community in general wants and expects from redditors – <em>value.</em></p>\n<p>Yes, they want value to be contributed from each and every active member of a subreddit. And this really means no bullshit. If all you’re going to do is try and sell to other redditors, then you will not be making a valuable contribution to the community or the discussion – so expect to find yourself banned within a matter of days.</p>\n<p>And so that really means that, as a marketer, you need to treat Reddit as if it were your blog – only that you do not host it yourself, and you are literally fighting for your chance to be read and recognised amongst many other people who are fighting for the same thing <em>in the same space</em>.</p>\n<p>So, think about your blog – what sort of content are you producing for it? If you’re sensible, then you won’t just be peddling your products, you will be <em>adding value</em> to your brand, and giving users lots of extra reasons to visit your website. This means that you will be posting top tips, latest industry news, tutorials, guidelines, opinion pieces and much more besides. In fact, very little of this will be directly related to your business – and you must adopt the same attitude when creating and curating content for Reddit.</p>\n<p>Redditors don’t like being sold to – nor even pitched to – they like discussion and opinions. And so, I think the lesson for marketers here can essentially be broken down into three vital points:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>1. Be Human</h3>\n<p>Yes, you are representing your brand, but you <em>are not </em>your brand. You are a real person with real opinions, emotions, funny smells and all the rest. In order to earn the respect of other redditors in a subreddit, you need to be relatable as a human being. Respect the rules and the redditquette, for moderators tend to take no prisoners.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>2. Be Accessible</h3>\n<p>If you decide to go down the Reddit path, then do so wholeheartedly. The voting system means that you can very quickly upset Reddit’s algorithms if you get lots of downvotes for not engaging within a subreddit that you’re supposed to be a part of. So, respond to comments and private messages quickly – especially those comments that have been upvoted by other redditors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>3. Don’t Be Selfish</h3>\n<p>This is extremely important. If you want to be an active part of a subreddit community, then you need to be consistently involved with other people’s posts as well as your own.

You may have noticed that some markets are more competitive. A great number of players using advanced tactics, yet observing lower than global average Open Rates and CTRs. Other industries on the other hand, seem to have plenty to catch up in terms of methods and techniques, but observe much higher than the average results.</p>\n<p>What does that all mean? To be able to assess one&#8217;s performance, marketers must be able to be able to compare both the global as well as the industry-specific results. That is why <a href="http://www.holisticemailmarketing.com/">Holistic Email Marketing</a>, an email marketing consultancy, <a href="http://www.getresponse.com/">GetResponse</a>, an email marketing and online campaign management platform, and <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/">Smart Insights</a>, publishers of digital advice, have teamed up to conduct a major online marketing study.</p>\n<p>Striving to empower marketers to improve their communication strategies, we&#8217;ve prepared a report that will help you compare your performance against your competitors&#8217; and global benchmarks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The study</h2>\n<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1oj48vZ" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft wp-image-22766" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Pasted-image-at-2016_02_15-01_22-PM-212x300.png" alt="Pasted image at 2016_02_15 01_22 PM" width="170" height="241" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Pasted-image-at-2016_02_15-01_22-PM-768x1089.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Pasted-image-at-2016_02_15-01_22-PM-722x1024.png 722w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Pasted-image-at-2016_02_15-01_22-PM-762x1080.png 762w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Pasted-image-at-2016_02_15-01_22-PM.png 890w" sizes="(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px" /></a>During July and August 2015, a group of 1831 Smart Insights members and GetResponse customers around the world have taken part in an online marketing study.

In addition to adding to your existing unique media, curated content allows you to demonstrate more versatility, an ability to work with others, and industry awareness that simply creating unique information does not. Getting started with curation can be intimidating, but once you get started, it can benefit nearly any platform.<span id="more-22728"></span></p>\n<p>Content curation is the process of gathering, creating, and compiling information on a specific subject and presenting it to readers. In fact, content curation is found almost everywhere on the Internet, on social media pages, RSS feeds, and even social bookmarking sites like Digg. It&#8217;s also an extremely useful tool for marketers, who can use curated content to increase the value whether for B2C or B2B marketing.</p>\n<p>Importantly, content curation isn’t just about using other people&#8217;s content, as curation is often used to source topics, industry news, and ideas for creating unique content. Content curation applies to many parts of the Internet including social media platforms like Twitter, blogs, company websites, newsletters, and even picture sharing sites like Instagram.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Process</h2>\n<p>Content curation is a relatively simple process once you figure it out, but it can be complicated and even intimidating when you first get started. There is a lot of information on the web, in fact, WordPress statistics show that WordPress blogs alone get some <a href="https://wordpress.com/activity/" target="_blank">52.8 million new posts</a> every month. That&#8217;s a lot to sort through. You&#8217;ll need a strategy, some sort of selection criteria, and you will have to keep testing your content to tweak it in order to adjust to the best content for your readers.</p>\n<p><strong>Creating a Theme</strong> &#8211; A theme is usually the easiest part of content curation. You decide what you want your content to be about, and you narrow your options down based on that. But, you can narrow it down further. If you have a specific niche, and you&#8217;re providing marketing for window washing companies, then you can narrow your topic down to content surrounding window washing. This is a significantly smaller niche, so you&#8217;ll have less content, and less to sort through. Your theme is important because it has to appeal to your clients rather than to you. It’s also important because it has to be extremely relevant to them and to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Choosing Selection Criteria</strong> – Your selection criteria is important for quality control. If you&#8217;re sharing or linking to other people&#8217;s content, it&#8217;s important that you read every post to ensure that it holds up to the standards you want to offer to your readers. Some other points should apply whether you&#8217;re writing your own content or not.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Value </strong>&#8211; Each piece has to offer value in exchange for the time spent reading it</li>\n<li><strong>Relevance</strong> &#8211; Will your readers benefit from this topic?</li>\n<li><strong>Interest </strong>&#8211; Is it exciting? Clickable? Interesting to read?</li>\n<li><strong>Quality</strong> &#8211; You don&#8217;t want click bait titles, poor writing quality, or something that everyone and their figurative mother will be sharing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These points are especially important on Twitter, where data shows that many people will Retweet a link without reading it first. Content aggregation, especially automated programs that share content based on hashtags can be dangerous, because the content you&#8217;re sharing might be very bad. Taking the time to read through everything you share or post is important for quality assurance.</p>\n<p><strong>Research</strong> &#8211; Part of content curation is research, which includes researching your own topics, keywords, search terms, where to find quality content, and what your readers want to see. Ideas include keywords on your website, common industry questions, industry news, tips, how-to&#8217;s, and so on in your niche. If you&#8217;re curating content to create unique content, then you should definitely consider researching your own unique angles and approaches to other topics so that your ideas are unique.</p>\n<p>You also have to integrate ongoing research for market testing. No marketing campaign, including content, is valuable without analytics, A/B testing to improve, and tracking the value you get from your time spent on it. If you&#8217;re spending four hours a week creating a high quality curated newsletter and you&#8217;re only getting 50 clicks from it, you&#8217;re obviously doing something wrong. Integrating analytics into your content curation allows you to test headlines, text content topics, and different types of organization and attribution.</p>\n<p><strong>Presenting Curated Content</strong> &#8211; Presentation is key to any curated content. Not only do you have to properly attribute and reference any material you share or quote, you have to present your material in an order and style that is not only useful to readers, but interesting as well. It&#8217;s not enough to simply share content based on what&#8217;s popular, as this won&#8217;t get you anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/DMPSL-1qMG8" target="_blank">Howard Rheingold suggests</a> that fine tuning your topic and creating a niche based on what people want to see is a valuable service, because the Internet alone does not do that. If you sift through content and present information in a specific way, you are offering value.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plan your content. Planned content allows users to make informed decisions on when to come back. For example, knowing that you share an industry article on Monday&#8217;s, followed by a how-to on the topic on Tuesdays, and an expert interview on Wednesday will keep many people coming back for more.</li>\n<li>Decide which types of posts to put up, and when</li>\n<li>Integrate different types of media, but don&#8217;t feel the need to balance them evenly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Tools for Content Curation</h2>\n<p>There are hundreds of tools you can use for content curation, and some of them are more helpful than others. Some are also free, while others cost a great deal.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.google.com/alerts" target="_blank">Google Alerts</a> &#8211; One of the most powerful free tools available, Google Alerts will send you emails based on specific keywords and topics. You can also follow companies, Google Plus pages, and YouTube accounts in your Alerts.</li>\n<li><a href="https://support.google.com/news/answer/59255?hl=en" target="_blank">Google News Feeds</a> &#8211; You can sign up for Google Feeds for email updates on specific topics. Just click the RSS button on the bottom of any topic page and sign up.</li>\n<li>RSS &#8211; Most blogs offer some form of RSS, and signing up is easy. But, you still need an RSS reader. Options like <a href="https://feedly.com/i/welcome" target="_blank">Feedly</a>, <a href="http://digg.com/reader" target="_blank">Digg Reader</a>, <a href="http://feedafever.com/" target="_blank">Fever</a> (not free, but shows &#8216;hot&#8217; or popular content), and <a href="https://feedbin.com/" target="_blank">Feedbin</a> all offer varying features, apps, and value.</li>\n<li>Lists &#8211; Facebook and Twitter have options to create and use lists of people to follow their content. You can also add page and companies. This allows you to follow industry experts, other curators, and influencers to see what&#8217;s happening on social in your niche.</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.scoop.it/" target="_blank">It</a> &#8211; Content curation, sharing, and publishing in one app. Options range from free to Enterprise. The tool is extremely sophisticated and offers RSS, social media integration, news, and much more.</li>\n<li><a href="https://storify.com/" target="_blank">Storify by LiveFyre</a> &#8211; Free to enterprise content curation and sharing, including blogs and social media, with sophisticated search and tools.</li>\n<li><a href="https://hootsuite.com/" target="_blank">HooteSuite</a> &#8211; HooteSuite is a valuable sharing and scheduling tool, but you can also use it to view and curate keywords and content from around the web, and then share it immediately with your followers in app.</li>\n<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/flipboard-your-social-news/id358801284?mt=8" target="_blank">FlipBoard</a> &#8211; Flipboard is an app that curates content for you on your phone based on topics you pick. It also offers previews, so you can decide if you want to share it without dedicated a great deal of time.</li>\n<li><a href="https://sway.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Sway</a> &#8211; Microsoft Sway is free to Outlook.com users and allows you to create pages and presentation like web based content using a mix of self created and curated content. It also integrates directly with web media, so you can add in snippets and full articles from around the web, playable videos and podcasts, and much more. It&#8217;s not widely adopted yet, but it offers a more interactive version of a newsletter, that doesn’t have to be hosted on your own website.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Content curation is valuable tool for marketers of any kind because you can use it to add value to your social media, newsletter, blog, or any other shared content. Because experts like <a href="http://blog.hootsuite.com/beginners-guide-to-content-curation/" target="_blank">Kristina Cisnero</a> of HootSuite and Gary Vaynerchuk of VaynerMedia (in his book Jab Jab Jab Right Hook) suggest that about one third of your content should be interacting with your niche, your readers, and your influencers, it can also boost your social media marketing efforts.</p>\n<p>Sharing content shows your readers, other industry experts, and potential clients that you&#8217;re familiar with your industry, interested in it, and are willing to work with others. Over time, adding content into your social media, blog, and newsletter will also draw the people who want to read that content. If you&#8217;ve chosen your niche and topics correctly, those readers will be your client demographic.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you utilize content curation for your social media, blog, or newsletter?

And if, how can we cope when it seems to be so inevitable?<span id="more-22713"></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Good guy stress</h2>\n<p>Stress is nothing else as the body’s reaction to a difficult situation. We recognize that something may cause harm and so a whole chain of physiological processes is triggered to shape us up and get us ready to cope, whether it is fighting the problem or simply running away. So what does this really happen? An alarmed brain sends signals to our body and activates the sympathetic system – a system responsible for switching us on if there’s a need for a quick reaction. Adrenal glands start rushing adrenaline into to the blood stream, our heart beats faster pushing blood into muscles, heart rate and pulse rise, senses get sharper, and we are ready to go.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22721" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/im_ready_game_of_thrones.gif" alt="im_ready_game_of_thrones" width="500" height="233" /></p>\n<h6>(Image Source: <a href="http://www.reactiongifs.us/im-ready-game-of-thrones/" target="_blank">ReactionGifs</a>)</h6>\n<p>Imagine a hypothetical situation. You get a call from your boss that a very important meeting with some very important people will take place sooner than you expected (or you just messed up your agenda). You are in shambles, but at the back in your head you know you can manage. And then is when good guy stress (or eustress) kicks in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your attention span gets narrowed so you focus on a particular task</li>\n<li>your energy level gets a boost</li>\n<li>you feel excited and motivated to cope with the challenge</li>\n<li>your performance improves</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All in all, it turns out that the stress reaction is adaptive. However, you have to keep in mind that the parts of your brain that are in control of the processes depicted above are pretty old and not really <em>aware </em>of the fact that we are no longer fighting for survival hunting wild animals. Our body simply had no chance to catch up with the cultural and technological evolution. This means that a stress reaction can do a good job when the threat is an ad hoc situation, but was not designed to deal with long-term challenges. To put it in a job context – we are pretty well equipped to deal with a single stressful task, not an entire project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Mean stress</h2>\n<p>The bad news is that that the positive effects of stress will last for approximately 30 minutes. After that time, it starts to wreak our internal organs, immune and nervous systems. The reason behind this is obvious &#8211; keeping us alert requires a lot of energy, so our body cannot take care of itself like it would in a normal situation. The processes responsible for building up our organism shut down, digestive organs slow down, immune system stops fighting down viruses, bacteria, or other intruders. And if stress is prolonged, we head straight for exhaustion. There’s no time for regeneration, when you are on a survival mode.</p>\n<p>What can bad stress (distress) do to your body:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>muscle tension</li>\n<li>insomnia</li>\n<li>digestive problems</li>\n<li>loss of appetite</li>\n<li>susceptibility to infections</li>\n<li>hypertension</li>\n<li>strokes</li>\n<li>heart attacks</li>\n<li>cancer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Our primitive brain acting out</h2>\n<p>Stress takes a toil on our cognitive system as well. While at work we cannot do without our brain cells. So you may find it pretty disturbing that stress can actually lead to the shrinkage of gray matter. Most prone to damage is our prefrontal cortex – the part that takes over higher brain functions, such as reasoning, decision making, planning, and problem solving. That needs some time to happen of course.</p>\n<p>Mind that, however, when under stress, your prefrontal lobes will not be able to do its job properly. The more primitive, yet quicker, brain parts will be in charge. In consequence, available coping strategies may become limited to basic and not always adaptive routines. You may be more prompt to throw tantrums, get aggressive, uncooperative, or withdrawn. Moreover, stress lowers serotonin levesl that can lead to depression and obsessive compulsive behavior.</p>\n<p>Stress can heavily affect your emotions and reasoning in various ways. You may expect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>attention shifting and inability to focus</li>\n<li>intrusive thoughts</li>\n<li>worse understating of your (and others) emotional state</li>\n<li>sense of losing control</li>\n<li>blank mind</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What is even more important, long-term stress can become a problem itself. You focus more on the very fact that you are stressed out than on your job responsibilities. Tasks keep pilling up and the vicious circle gets tighter. Worst of all, your survival brain will look for shortcuts to deal with the problem – chocolate bar instead of a nourishing meal to restore energy level, alcohol or other substances to calm you down, or other destructive behaviors just to let the steam off.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22717" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/NewGirl_stress.gif" alt="NewGirl_stress" width="500" height="281" /></p>\n<h6>(Image Source: <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/elliewoodward/times-jess-from-new-girl-was-100-actually-you#.iuVM6zqdz" target="_blank">Buzzfeed</a>)</h6>\n<p>This is all a little gloomy isn’t it? So what can we do? We’ve got a few things to help you change your stressful ways!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Work stress busters</h2>\n<p>Let’s be honest &#8211; even the best work environment imagined cannot shelter you from being stressed. As I have mentioned previously, stress is a natural (or even neutral) reaction. All you can do is to learn how to cope with the mechanism before it turns against your mind and body.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Learn to detect stress symptoms</strong></h3>\n<p>The sooner you spot that stress starts to affect your general well-being, the better. You have to observe your body reactions and learn when you turn from enthusiastic into frantic. Try to detect when and why an adrenaline rush brings confusion that disorganizes your work. It may happen that stressful situations are linked with each other. Only when you understand the whole mechanism, will you be able to launch your personal stress prevention program.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Work out the stress pattern</strong></h3>\n<p>Breaking your daily work routine into smaller chunks may help you to get a better view of what actually happens when stress kicks in. Analyze step by step your behavior, circumstances, and people involved. The key here is to find out at which point you are more prone to suffer from stress and when you can relax and let the steam off. Then have a closer look at your coping strategies. Do you have any? Are they actually helpful? What are their costs? Can you change your behavior to become more efficient? Are you actually in force to improve your situation? Where can you seek support?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>3.  Get support</strong></h3>\n<p>Talk with your supervisor about the difficulties you have to tackle. Discuss together your workload and whether your tasks are in the scope of your capabilities. Don’t be afraid to be honest about your feelings and doubts.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22723" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/TheOffice.gif" alt="TheOffice" width="500" height="289" /></p>\n<h6>(Image Source: <a href="http://www.brostrick.com/celebrity-news/tv-recaps/best-michael-scott-quotes-the-office/" target="_blank">brostrick</a>)</h6>\n<p>However, stay as constructive as possible. Complaining won’t help at all. This also applies to your fellow workers. Don’t brood on how hard you’ve got it, but ask for specific advice. And at all times avoid taking out your anger on others. You will quickly realize that what goes around comes around.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Ease up on perfectionism</strong></h3>\n<p>Excessive perfectionism is an easy way to exhaustion. Rethink the quality of your job and stay with the good enough level. Taking the extra mile each time you have a project to deliver is simply impossible. Setting unrealistic goals will not only bring your nerves to the edge, but will also result in losing sense of control and lowering your self-esteem.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>5. Balance your work and private life</strong></h3>\n<p>Don’t make yourself be available 24 hours a day – you need some work-free space to get your mind and body balanced. And I am not talking about over-hours you do in the evenings to catch up with your work. That is something that comes down to the point I have discussed above. To clean your mind, you will have to shelter yourself from all the factors that remind you of work.</p>\n<p>Stay away from your work by not checking your mobile all the time. Its very presence may keep your sympathetic system going on, so you will not be able to relax. Moreover, it may be pretty difficult to resist the temptation to browse your mailbox, when the phone lies on your dinner table. Get yourself busy with other activities instead. Find some time for your social life, get involved in an interesting hobby, do anything you like that can effectively draw your attention from your work life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>6. Look after your body</strong></h3>\n<p>A hungry man is an angry man, and a hungry body is a stressed body! Do not feed your stress by skipping meals or gorging on whatever comes to your hand. Plan your meals ahead. Have a nourishing breakfast, find time for lunch (preferably not in front of the computer screen) and keep healthy snacks nearby.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22725" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/BradPittDance.gif" alt="BradPittDance" width="427" height="351" /></p>\n<h6>(Image Source: <a href="http://s284.photobucket.com/user/Bigsteve87/media/Gifs/BradPittDance.gif.html" target="_blank">Photobucket</a>)</h6>\n<p>Stress likes a sedentary lifestyle as well, so try doing sports. A dash of endorphins after a mild workout will keep your body and mind less vulnerable. However, if you need an instant relief after a hard workday – work out till you drop. When you are a bundle of nerves, a moderate activity will only higher your heart rate and your body will keep you on your fight or flight mode.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>To sum it up</h2>\n<p>Stress is in the eye of the beholder – while putting in carbs will do no or little harm. The general recipe is quite simple: listen to your body, understand its reaction, and make more conscious decisions while coping with difficult time.

Or that you can’t get any value from the platform.<span id="more-22680"></span></p>\n<h2>In defense of small</h2>\n<p>Many micro-influencers in small niches have only a couple hundred Twitter followers. They are reasonably active on the platform, but they tend to follow or be followed by people they actually know or work with. Hidden in those “small” groups of their followers you can find CEOs, Marketing Directors, and other heavyweights.</p>\n<p>Those heavyweights are the type of people who make million dollar decisions. They tend to be more focused on managing and growing their businesses than on expanding their Twitter following. Never write someone off just because you see a small following.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22685" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/LarryAlton-1.jpg" alt="Larry Alton" width="630" height="352" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/LarryAlton-1-300x168.jpg 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/LarryAlton-1-768x429.jpg 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/LarryAlton-1-1024x572.jpg 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/LarryAlton-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>Larry Alton’s Twitter bio comes across as pretty humble. Don’t be fooled: He’s a columnist for <em>Entrepreneur, Inc, HuffPost, TechCrunch</em> and <em>Search Engine Journal</em>.</p>\n<p>This “hidden influencer” phenomenon is why you have to be careful when you cull who you follow on Twitter. Most of the tools that calculate how influential people are only go by behavior on Twitter. That’s not the full scope of someone’s actual influence.</p>\n<p>A small Twitter follower count can also hide engagement. I came across an influencer marketing company recently that defines an influencer based on how many engagement signals someone gets from each tweet. They didn’t even mention follower count. They don’t care. But if you get more than five retweets, likes or replies for <em>every</em> tweet you post, according to them, you’re an influencer.</p>\n<p>You’ve probably heard this tune in email marketing. “You can still make money with a small, targeted list.” It’s true. But I think there’s another argument that’s better at proving why engagement is <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/10-ways-to-get-more-engagement-from-your-social-media-posts.html" target="_blank">what really matters</a>. It’s in the math.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width="115">Twitter followers</td>\n<td width="111">Tweets</td>\n<td width="121">Average Engagement Rate</td>\n<td width="97">Number of Engagements</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="115">1,000</td>\n<td width="111">130</td>\n<td width="121">.24</td>\n<td width="97">31,200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width="115">3,000</td>\n<td width="111">130</td>\n<td width="121">.07</td>\n<td width="97">27,300</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>So before you go all out to grow a big Twitter following, ask yourself: Do I really want a big Twitter following… simply to have a big Twitter following? Or do I actually want to get some business out of this, even if it’s just some exposure via engagement?</p>\n<p>If you want more engagement, it’s the people with 500 followers or less who are most likely to give it to you. That’s what Mention reports in their ebook, <a href="http://info.mention.com/the-essential-guide-to-increasing-engament-on-social-media" target="_blank">“The When Where Who and How of Communicating Online to Get More Mentions.”</a></p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22687" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Mention91Percent-1-1024x235.png" alt="Mention91Percent" width="630" height="144" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Mention91Percent-1-300x69.png 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Mention91Percent-1-768x176.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Mention91Percent-1-1024x235.png 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/Mention91Percent-1.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<p>Engagement matters. It’s the metric most of us measure the success or failure of our content by. Especially when it comes to blog posts.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22690" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/content-kpis1.png" alt="content-kpis1" width="630" height="385" /></p>\n<p>One of BrightLocal’s <a href="https://www.brightlocal.com/2015/12/16/social-shares-are-the-most-important-content-kpis/" target="_blank">recent polls</a> shows how social shares are the most common measurement of whether a blog post is successful or not.</p>\n<p>Now, should we all be that focused on getting lots of shares? Probably not. I’d prefer it if more of us focused on actual results: Conversions, leads, etc. The kind of stuff that makes a direct business impact. But the power of social proof is real. You could make the argument that the number of social shares gives credibility to a piece of content. (At least before Twitter took away our share counts. Grrr.)</p>\n<p>It’s the social proof factor that’s why so many people crave a larger following on Twitter. We humans tend to believe that if lots of other humans like something, then it must be good. That if something is being clamored for and talked about, it must be important.</p>\n<p>Twitter is a great tool for clamoring. And liking things. And finding out what other people like. And while engagement is where the ROI is, let’s face it: Size matters. Who doesn’t want more Twitter followers?</p>\n<p>So enough about making do with a small following. If you want to grow your Twitter followers, there are four strategies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Attract them.</strong> Either by being well-known or by tweeting out really good stuff, formatted for maximum shares.</li>\n<li><strong>Ask for them.</strong> Add prompts to follow you wherever possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Network for them</strong>. Follow people so they’ll follow you back.</li>\n<li><strong>Pay for them.</strong> Advertise for them or buy them outright. Just kidding. You should never buy followers outright.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s break these out.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Attract them</h2>\n<p>Want to be followed? Then be worth following. Here’s the to-do list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lose the egg. Put up a professional quality headshot.</li>\n<li>Use an attractive, high-resolution background image. It’s nice if it’s not screamingly promotional.</li>\n<li>Use a Twitter handle that’s memorable and fits your business or niche. The closer you can get it to your name or business name, the better. @DrewDavies is ideal. @DrewTheAnimal is only appropriate for wrestlers. @Drew09334 looks like a spam account.</li>\n<li>Write a Twitter bio that’s sprinkled with carefully chosen hashtags and keywords.</li>\n<li>Follow other people in your niche.</li>\n<li>Retweet other people’s content.</li>\n<li>If someone tweets about you, thank them.</li>\n<li>Use images in your tweets. They get 18% more engagement.</li>\n<li>Be an informer, not a meformer. Don’t make it all about you.</li>\n<li>Don’t “burst” your tweets or retweets. Ie, don’t tweet several times in the same minute.</li>\n<li>Don’t send automated Direct Messages to new followers. It weirds us out.</li>\n<li>Tweet things that would be useful to your ideal audience.</li>\n<li>Find out when the best time for you to tweet is.</li>\n<li>Pin a tweet that gets lots of engagement to the top of your feed.</li>\n<li><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/complete-guide-using-hashtags.html" target="_blank">Use hashtags</a> in your tweets. But only one or two.</li>\n<li>Mix up the content formats in your tweets. A little bit links, a little bit images, a little bit videos…</li>\n<li>Participate in Twitter chats, like the one <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/atomicchat?src=hash" target="_blank">AtomicReach</a> hosts every week.</li>\n<li>Tweet regularly. There’s a correlation between followers and how often someone tweets:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22696" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/TweetsVsFollowers.jpg" alt="TweetsVsFollowers" width="564" height="294" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/TweetsVsFollowers-300x156.jpg 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/TweetsVsFollowers.jpg 564w" sizes="(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px" /></p>\n<h2>Ask for them</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add your Twitter handle and a call to action to follow you to the signature of your emails.</li>\n<li>Embed <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/tweetthis/" target="_blank">“Tweet this”</a> links in your blog posts.</li>\n<li>When you guest post, include your Twitter handle in your biography.</li>\n<li>When someone has just signed up for your email list &#8211; on the final confirmation page – ask them to follow you on Twitter.</li>\n<li>Add a prompt to follow you to the footer of your website.</li>\n<li>Add a prompt to follow you to your business card, and all other printed materials (even invoices).</li>\n<li>Use an overlay tool like <a href="http://snip.ly/" target="_blank">Snip.ly</a>. It lets you add an overlay to every link you share. You can use that overlay space to ask someone to follow you or to subscribe to your email list.</li>\n<li>Get on <a href="http://twiends.com" target="_blank">Twiends.com</a>. It’s a directory of Twitter users that helps people grow their following.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Network for them</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Start following people you know, especially people you know from other social platforms. Most of them will follow you back.</li>\n<li>Use any of the Twitter tools (like Followerwonk) that let you find people based on their interests, bio or connections.</li>\n<li>If you don’t want to pay for a service to find you good followers, go to the follower lists of people you admire in your niche. Follow whomever they’re following (so long as it makes sense). Many of them will follow you back. This is still my preferred way to find great followers.</li>\n<li>Use a paid tool like Narrow.io (<a href="http://narrow.io/">http://narrow.io/</a>) or SocialQuant (<a href="http://www.socialquant.net/">http://www.socialquant.net/</a>) to automate the “find and follow people who are likely to follow you” process. I’ve tried both of these tools and got decent results. SocialQuant got me significantly more followers than Narrow.io, but I like the controls that Narrow.io gives. With SocialQuant you basically just hand the reins over to them and they grow your account for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Pay for them</h2>\n<p>As social media comes of age, I think we’re all going to get more and more used to paying for access. Same goes for Twitter followers.</p>\n<p>I was highly resistant to the idea of advertising for followers, but I finally broke down and tried it. And got Twitter followers for 22 cents each. If I had switched off showing ads to users in a couple of low-performing countries, I could have gotten it down to 18 cents. And that was with just the first two ads I tried &#8211; with split-testing I could definitely get it down further. Larry Kim got his cost per new follower down to <a href="https://moz.com/blog/guide-to-buying-legit-twitter-followers" target="_blank">13 cents</a>.</p>\n<p>What worked? Well, I targeted my audience to followers of people and businesses that my tweets might resonate with (places like Marketing Profs and The Content Marketing Institute). Then I tried different ad formats: a Promoted Tweet and a straight up Follower Campaign. The Promoted Tweet got more followers, but at pretty much the same cost as the Follower Campaign.</p>\n<p>Trouble was, the number of new followers was just a trickle. I had been naturally getting about 40-50 new followers a week with no advertising or other tactics, so seeing only about 15 new followers per day wasn’t that big a lift. I could probably have improved that count by split-testing the ads so they converted better, and then upped my minimum bids a bit so Twitter would give the ads more impressions.</p>\n<p>Dollar for dollar, I’d probably skip advertising. SocialQuant or Narrow.io would get more followers for the money.</p>\n<p>Bonus: Another way to “pay” for Twitter followers is to offer a discount to new followers. And it works. Discounts are the #1 reason people follow brands.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22697" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/WhyPeopleFollowBrands-1-1024x589.png" alt="WhyPeopleFollowBrands" width="630" height="362" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/WhyPeopleFollowBrands-1-768x442.png 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/WhyPeopleFollowBrands-1-1024x589.png 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/WhyPeopleFollowBrands-1.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>You’re spoiled for choice when it comes to growing your Twitter account. And while there are tools that can speed up the process, it’s better to not try to hit 10,000 followers in your first month.</p>\n<p>Go for quality, and get your Twitter skills sharp first. Then, if you want to try out advertising or some of the paid growth tools, have at it. They do actually work. I checked my Twitter account for fake followers after doing all this advertising and still got a squeaky-clean report.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think?</strong></p>\n<p>What’s your preferred way to get more followers on Twitter?

At GetResponse we thought the latter and instead of killing it, as some Greek guy did long time ago, we decided to tame Hydra, and make it work for a better tomorrow <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>\n<p>So… what hides under this ‘cute’ nickname is our in-house anti-abuse system we, as GetRespose, have been developing for quite some time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cool, dude, cool, but what for?!</h2>\n<p>As with many other ESPs, GetResponse is exploited by spammers and a variety of bad actors in order to send spam. During the summer of 2014 spam threats were flooding our Compliance Team and left very little place for what we think should be main role of the Compliance Dept. &#8211; helping our customers to stay in compliance with email industry standards as well as our own policies.</p>\n<p>We were fighting waves of bad guys with baseball bats. And so, we needed something more, something that could do the heavy lifting for us, do all the leg work so that people with expert knowledge will not spend their energy on tasks that should be automated.</p>\n<p>The Idea was simple &#8211; automate as much as you can with as small room for error as is possible. To do so we really needed our very own Hydra &#8211; in case you bypass one of the heads, another still keeps an eye out for you. Over the course of 18 months we were able to create a system that helps us assess risk related to GetResponse accounts, then launching automated operations accordingly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>First bricks, first success.</h2>\n<p>Every project needs to start somewhere, so a desire to get to the low hanging fruits drove us to conclude that we should start by mimicking processes we did by hand. At first we translated into a bunch of simple rules, what we usually did manually, to fish out malicious, free accounts that flooded us at that time.</p>\n<p>Although we tried a few approaches finally we saw that certain IP spaces or mailbox providers can be linked to bad actors with almost a 100% certainty. That part was pretty easy, now we had a net full of accounts and we had to do something with it. What should we do to minimize false positive rates so as to not make legitimate customers life difficult, while making sure that those we need to repel do not slip away?</p>\n<p>Here enters the spam mitigation philosophy. Big words, I know <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> For us it translated into a simple, well known idea – increase the cost of operations for bad guys. So we did, in August 2014 we first introduced text verification for those accounts that Hydra sniffed, gazed at, and finally put label the “high risk” on. It was a huge break for our Compliance Team, over the course of a few months we were able to lower the number of abusive free accounts we had to take care of by over 4 times.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>We were just getting started.</h2>\n<p>Those of you who have anything to do with security know it is a constant arms race. One side comes up with an idea how to patch a hole in the wall, then someone else finds a new one a few meters further. It is a drag. So it’s good to have something that will adjust to changing circumstances, right? Right.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22706" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/youre_right.gif" alt="youre_right" width="485" height="242" /></p>\n<h6>(Image source: <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/U1XhGr8CWqvVC/giphy.gif" target="_blank">Giphy</a>)</h6>\n<p>After the first success we developed Hydra further. With the help of our bio-engineering team we mutated Hydra’s DNA so our little pet could grow new heads and expand its brain size… OK, just kidding, we simply wrote hundreds of lines of code. From a bunch of simple rules, we evolved it into a creation that can learn from what it finds.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22707" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/typing.gif" alt="typing" width="461" height="259" /></p>\n<h6>(Image source: <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/VHHxxFAeLaYzS/giphy.gif" target="_blank">Giphy</a>)</h6>\n<p>If you ever imported subscribers into a GetResponse account, your list went through a verification process. At first it was done totally by hand, based on expert knowledge from our anti-abuse specialists. You can imagine that such a process took hours, required a lot of manpower, all of that so we could ensure the highest deliverability possible throughout the entire GetResponse platform.</p>\n<p>A huge step forward was made by making Hydra do the heavy lifting for us, even more, we altered the whole process to make it more thorough, as time required to review a list was no longer a factor we had to consider &#8211; Hydra devours even the biggest of lists within seconds.</p>\n<p>At this point Hydra was no longer an internal anti-abuse system, it brought real value to our customers, lowering list import time from hours to minutes. Moreover, the whole infrastructure we created for the sole purpose of list reviewing was used to pave ground for a feature that helps marketers get higher open and click rates of their mailings &#8211; <a href="https://support.getresponse.com/faq/what-is-perfect-timing-and-how-does-it-work" target="_blank">Perfect Timing</a>. Again &#8211; the more lists Hydra goes through, the better it can score and review future lists.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>How about some more mutagens?</h2>\n<p>That was what we thought &#8211; let’s go further, what else Hydra can help us with? A few months after the success of the new, automated list review process we decided that we are ready to implement the same rules for real time subscriptions. That was a bit of a challenge, though. See, when a list is uploaded for import we can look at it as one entity. It is pretty easy to find correlations with other lists, score all the email addresses, and decide whether or not hygiene of the list is good enough to be approved, when you have everything in front of you.</p>\n<p>With a constant stream of subscriptions, they need to be considered somewhat differently. First of all, scores for a list that was sent to in the past will be different than for new subscribers that just placed their email address in the webform or closed a shopping cart (i.e. with all the syntax errors). The idea behind unleashing Hydra on the live feed was that it can help our customers who became victims of malicious scripts, bots, or any other kind of address injection. With that in place we were also able to remove the required double opt-in subscription for API and put in place a process granting single opt-in for API scripts far behind us &#8211; another win for all of our customers!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>TL;DR? Ok, here is the conclusion.</h2>\n<p>Hydra’s automation helped us save thousand and thousands of work hours both for us and our customers, and it made the Compliance Team available when it is really needed &#8211; helping customers with expert knowledge. It also drastically improved experience connected to compliance and security processes that are required from whitehat ESP’s for our customers.</p>\n<p>Hydra’s decision array is made out of hundreds of single tests, all those “heads” are on the lookout for different patterns and factors. We constantly develop our little pet so it can do more tricks and adapt to new threats we come across every day. #keepcalmandhailhydra <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>\n\n<div class="wp_rp_wrap  wp_rp_plain" ><div class="wp_rp_content"><h3 class="related_post_title">Related posts</h3><ul class="related_post wp_rp"><li data-position="0" data-poid="in-22299" data-post-type="none" ><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/cookies.html" class="wp_rp_thumbnail"><img width="150" height="150" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/01/photo-1422207215953-98b4bc18c3d9-150x150.jpeg" class="attachment-0x0 size-0x0 wp-post-image" alt="photo-1422207215953-98b4bc18c3d9" /></a><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/cookies.html" class="wp_rp_title">Don’t Fear The &#8220;Cookies&#8221; Monster</a></li><li data-position="1" data-poid="in-20283" data-post-type="none" ><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/solution-to-common-issues-while-coding-in-wordpress.html" class="wp_rp_thumbnail"><img width="150" height="150" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2015/07/coding-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-0x0 size-0x0 wp-post-image" alt="coding" /></a><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/solution-to-common-issues-while-coding-in-wordpress.html" class="wp_rp_title">Solutions to Common Issues While Coding in WordPress</a></li></ul></div></div>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.getresponse.com/my-business-card-says-hydra-keeper.html">My Business Card Says “Hydra Keeper”</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.getresponse.com">GetResponse Blog - Email Marketing Tips</a>.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"http://blog.getresponse.com/my-business-card-says-hydra-keeper.html/feed";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:42:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"The Step-By-Step Guide To Creating A Webinar That Sells";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"http://blog.getresponse.com/step-step-guide-creating-webinar-sells.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"http://blog.getresponse.com/step-step-guide-creating-webinar-sells.html#respond";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 16:03:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"MARKETING";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"http://blog.getresponse.com/?p=22636";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:620:"<p>Are you thinking of using webinars to sell more of your products, programs or packages Congratulations!

It’s called ‘<a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/create-your-first-webinar.html" target="_blank">How to create your first webinar’</a>. Definitely check it out because it will surely answer all your starter questions.</p>\n<p>If you have presented on a few webinars, and you feel confident that you are ready to learn how to convert live attendees into buyers, this post is a must read for you.</p>\n<p>Let’s dive straight in.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Be crystal clear on your goal</h2>\n<p>Before you start planning your webinar, consider these questions:</p>\n<h3><strong>What are you going to sell?</strong></h3>\n<p>You can sell almost anything on a webinar. It can be a product, an online course, a coaching package, a done-for-you service or a live workshop. If you have more than one to offer, pick one.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have anything to sell at the moment (you might be a newly certified coach, a blogger wanting to monetize their blog or somebody interested in monetizing a passion project or a hobby), consider offering a live workshop that can be taught in the form of a paid webinar using the same tools, or coaching sessions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Is your product evergreen or do you have a cart closing?</strong></h3>\n<p>Assuming you are new to selling on webinars, I highly recommend that you pick a evergreen product, meaning, don’t complicate the whole thing by picking something that requires closing cart on a certain day.</p>\n<p>If you choose a product or service for which there is a deadline, this will put you under a lot of pressure. You’ll feel desperate to fill the spots because registration closes on a certain date. You’ll worry about what if you don’t get enough enrolments or buyers.</p>\n<p>Just make things easy for yourself and do a promo for something that doesn’t begin or end on a certain date. I’ll tell you how you can add urgency or create scarcity and still sell even though the offer is still available in a minute.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>How many buyers do you want?</strong></h3>\n<p>Based on your price point, work out how many clients or customers you’ll need to hit your income goal.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you are selling a $500 coaching package. You want to make five thousand dollars on the webinar. You would need 10 people to buy from you.</p>\n<p>Now, I want you to come up with your numbers carefully here because it will set the tone for all the subsequent decisions you make. So if you are new, don’t aim for a six-figure webinar. Come up with something that makes you feel excited and not feel so stressed that you actually have a panic attack on the day (guilty!).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Choose the right topic for your webinar</h2>\n<p>You may think that choosing a topic for your webinar is super hard. In reality, it can be very simple once you know how to do it right.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Don’t reinvent the wheel.</strong></h3>\n<p>Look at the blog posts that go viral. Look at the webinars that attract thousands of attendees. What do they have in common? Their topic is super specific, they often arouse curiosity and they also promise a big benefit. Do the same.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Solve a single problem.</strong></h3>\n<p>Firstly, your webinar needs to be super helpful above anything else. It doesn’t require slick slides, you don’t have to be the world’s greatest speaker, and you might face an occasional tech glitch and still have a successful webinar because the content was so valuable.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to give value is to solve a problem your audience has. Now here’s where most people go wrong. They give away so much that they end up overwhelming their audience. They make their audience feel it’s too much work to get what they want and so they don’t buy.</p>\n<p>The trick is to pick one challenge your audience faces and help them solve it. Then give some of your best stuff away so even if your audience doesn’t buy anything from you, they feel like it was the best use of their time and end up becoming a loyal advocate. They might also buy the next time or tell their friends about you so consider that a win.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>The logical next step is your product.</strong></h3>\n<p>You will educate people about why they are struggling. So you talk about the ‘why’. You also tell them what needs to happen to solve their problem and show them the ‘how’.</p>\n<p>On the webinar, you will pick one specific area and teach them something. This is the ‘what’. However, you will offer your product or service as the complete solution. This is critical. Your topic needs to come off of your offer. Your offer dictates the topic of your webinar. If you choose a topic that has nothing to do with that you are selling, you will find it very hard to transition into a pitch.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Step 3: Get people to sign up for your webinar</h2>\n<p>Now its time to promote your webinar. Here are the most effective ways to do it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Before you promote your webinar on which you intend to sell, do a series of list building webinars. Go check out <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/create-your-first-webinar.html" target="_blank">this post</a> again to know how to do this exactly.</li>\n<li>Join Facebook groups where your ideal audience hangs out and promote if they allow it.</li>\n<li>Promote the sign up link on various social media platforms.</li>\n<li>Reach out to other businesses and bloggers whose audiences you can help and ask them to promote.</li>\n<li>Run Facebook ads to fill up the seats.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>How many registrants do you need?</strong></h3>\n<p>Even before you start promoting your webinar, you need to know how many registrants do you need. Going back to that number of buyers you figured out above, you now need to work out how many people you need to register for your webinar to meet your money goal.</p>\n<p>Usually, the number of people converting on a webinar can be around 3-5% on average. So assuming everything goes to plan, aim to get 300-400 registrants to secure your 10 clients.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Create a killer registration page</strong></h3>\n<p>Sending traffic to your registration page is great but now you need them to sign up. For this, you need to make sure your page is high converting.</p>\n<p>Again, since you have come up with a killer topic for your webinar, your job ahead has already become so much easier. Trust me when I say this, nailing your topic is the harder part, the rest is just the matter of making sure people understand your free offer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start with the headline of your page. Usually, it is the topic of your webinar and highlights the benefits. It needs to be specific and make a big promise.</li>\n<li>Make sure you tell people somewhere that it is a free, live, training webinar. If people are not used to words like webinar in your industry, you can call it a live training workshop or class, that is fine.</li>\n<li>Under the webinar title, you will give the bullets further explaining what they will get out of the webinar. Try to invoke people’s curiosity while detailing the benefit. Entice them with their copy so they feel like they must sign up.</li>\n<li>Ask for their name and email address, and perhaps their phone number if your service allows you to send text reminders.</li>\n<li>Add some credibility building elements if you can. Add a testimonial or praise from an influencer. Add ‘as-seen-on’ logos. Don’t forget to include your smiling photo so people can connect with you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Start promoting your webinar before a week. 5-7 days is ideal and don’t go more than 10 days because people will forget what they signed up for.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-22666" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/webinar-1024x768.jpeg" alt="webinar" width="633" height="475" srcset="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/webinar-300x225.jpeg 300w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/webinar-768x576.jpeg 768w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/webinar-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2016/02/webinar-1440x1080.jpeg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /></p>\n<h2>Step 4: Get people to attend live</h2>\n<p>So this the story so far: You choose your product, then come up with the perfect idea for the webinar. You create a killer registration page and send targeted traffic to it so people can sign up.</p>\n<p>What’s the next step?</p>\n<p>To get people to turn up live. Because the majority of your sales will happen with people who are live on the webinar.</p>\n<p>Once somebody signs up, <strong>you will begin the onboarding or indoctrination sequence</strong>. This sequence is simply a series of emails that will be sent out to everyone who registers.</p>\n<p>Depending on the email service you use, you can use the autoresponder to set this up. Let’s say you start promoting on day 7 (counting down to the webinar). Somebody who signs up on this day will receive a thank you email there and then, then one email on day 5, then one on day 2 and finally on day 1. So they are receiving 4 emails altogether. On the other hand, somebody who joins on day 2 (again, counting down) will only receive the thank you email and those emails that are scheduled on day 2 and 1.</p>\n<p>Remember, these emails are different to the standard webinar reminder emails that your webinar service (<a href="http://www.getresponse.com/features/webinars.html" target="_blank">GetResponse Webinars,</a> for example) will send out automatically. You are using onboarding emails to create anticipation and excitement for your webinar. You are giving them extra information. You are building a story that leads them into your webinar. You can even offer a freebie download.</p>\n<p>To further entice people, <strong>offer a workbook people can use to follow along while you teach or a webinar-only bonus for people who attend live</strong>. Again, your webinar success depends on how many actually show up so do the work. It will be worth it.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<h2>Step 5: Sell confidently and follow up</h2>\n<p>So this is the part that scares most people. How to make a pitch and not throw up while you are doing it?</p>\n<p><strong>In order to make a flawless pitch, you have to feel like you have earned the right of doing so</strong>. This is a simple mindset shift but it gives you tons of confidence. So how do you do it?</p>\n<p>It’s simple. Give a stellar presentation first. Make it totally worthwhile for them and give them highly valuable information that they can put into action today. Your content should be sooo could that you have no issues whatsoever transitioning into your pitch.</p>\n<p>Again, go check out <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/create-your-first-webinar.html" target="_blank">this post</a> where I gave you lots of tips in how to create a stellar presentation and deal with technology so everything goes smoothly.</p>\n<p>If the topic lends itself to your pitch naturally, the transition will be seamless. You can say something like, ‘Here’s what you need to do next if you want to go deeper with me, or learn from me, or work with me so you can achieve this result faster and with more confidence’. Play with the language. Speak from the heart. If your offer is good, and your desire to help is sincere, people can see that. And that’s a good thing.</p>\n<p>Explain your offer clearly and confidently and give people the link to purchase. <strong>Give them extra incentive to buy on the webinar</strong> so if you are selling a pre-recorded program, throw in a 30-min coaching session with you (you might add this personal time and give it to first 5 people who buy). If it’s a coaching package, add a done-for-you service or critique. Give them a special discount that will expire in 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>This is also how you would add urgency to your ever green offers</strong>. To add scarcity, you can restrict the number of seats you sell but know that this is what you really want to do and don’t create false scarcity. So this may be where you are only taking 5 one-on-one clients, for example.</p>\n<p>If you don’t get many sales, don’t be discouraged, you may still get a few during the post-webinar follow-up phase or when you tweak things and make your webinar even better the next time.</p>\n<p>Don’t forget you still have these people on your list. And remember, you can do this as many times as you want.</p>\n<p>Finally, don’t ignore the follow up process. Just like you created a series of 3-5 onboarding emails to get people to show up live, now you would create another 3-5 emails to get people to watch the replay and purchase your offer.</p>\n<p>You will get some people who are in a tricky time zone and although truly interested, couldn’t make it live (happens to me all the time) but also those who were initially on the fence. You might even catch those who just signed up for the free info but blown away by your free content. So, put some effort into it. Good luck.</p>\n<p>Phew! Selling on a webinar seems like a LOT of work, doesn’t it?</p>\n<p>Of course, it is. Anything worth doing, is.</p>\n<p>But remember, when you perfect your webinar presentation, pitch and follow-up, you can look forward to having a multiple 5-figure days. 30K in a day? Not too shabby, right? So work toward it. It will get easier. You can do this! <strong>Share your experiences in the comments below, we&#8217;d love to know how you&#8217;re succeeding.</strong></p>\n\n<div class="wp_rp_wrap  wp_rp_plain" ><div class="wp_rp_content"><h3 class="related_post_title">Related posts</h3><ul class="related_post wp_rp"><li data-position="0" data-poid="in-19447" data-post-type="none" ><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/9-excuses-keeping-you-from-creating-an-information-product.html" class="wp_rp_thumbnail"><img width="150" height="150" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2015/04/excuses-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-0x0 size-0x0 wp-post-image" alt="excuses" /></a><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/9-excuses-keeping-you-from-creating-an-information-product.html" class="wp_rp_title">9 Excuses Keeping You From Creating An Information Product</a></li><li data-position="1" data-poid="in-16328" data-post-type="none" ><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/build-profitable-customer-loyalty-program-whitepaper.html" class="wp_rp_thumbnail"><img width="150" height="150" src="http://blog.getresponse.com/uploads/2015/12/persuasion-150x150.jpeg" class="attachment-0x0 size-0x0 wp-post-image" alt="persuasion" /></a><a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/build-profitable-customer-loyalty-program-whitepaper.html" class="wp_rp_title">How to Build a Profitable Customer Loyalty Program #Whitepaper</a></li></ul></div></div>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.getresponse.com/step-step-guide-creating-webinar-sells.html">The Step-By-Step Guide To Creating A Webinar That Sells</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.getresponse.com">GetResponse Blog - Email Marketing Tips</a>.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"http://blog.getresponse.com/step-step-guide-creating-webinar-sells.html/feed";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:4:"href";s:32:"http://blog.getresponse.com/feed";s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:19:"application/rss+xml";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:44:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/";a:2:{s:12:"updatePeriod";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"hourly";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:15:"updateFrequency";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:4:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Wed, 09 Mar 2016 02:32:13 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:9:"text/html";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130910223210";}', 'no');

For that, she needs to have a perfect make-up kit among other priorities. However, when choosing the beauty or make up products you should keep in mind the long term effects its going to cause on your skin. You should use the skin care products along with make-up products as a precautionary measure to reduce the chances of spoiling your skin. Also, while shopping at a store, some girls find it hard to pick products at the cosmetics section. In this article, I have created a list of beauty supply that a girl should have to complete her makeup and skin care kit.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I will be writing articles progressively and posting them on this website to provide ladies with tips, tricks and guidance on how to properly use their makeup kits and use different cosmetics for different purposes like a pro. I will be comparing different products from all types of cosmetics from our beauty supply list so that the girls can make better choice on which product and brand to use or try.\r\n\r\nI will also be making efforts to find and recommend the right places, stores, companies or people to get the cheapest but good quality products for the users of this website so that they can afford to look attractive.\r\n\r\nYou can follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, etc.\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Cleanser</strong>\r\nA cleanser is used to wash away make-up, dirt, pollutants, oil and other impurities from the surface of the skin. Its a better alternative to bar soap and other skin cleansers because of various reasons such as:\r\n(i) Skin pH is about 4.7 where as soap has a high pH between 9-10, which can imbalance the skin pH thus causing further growth of bacteria increasing acne.\r\n(ii) Bar soap contains thickeners which clog up skin pores causing acne.\r\n(iii) Bar soap on the face removes natural oil which in turn causes sebaceous glands to overproduce oils causing acne. For these reasons, a facial cleanser is recommended instead of a soap to wash the face with. Usually, a cleanser is used as a part of skin care regimen in combination with a toner and a moisturizer.\r\n\r\nA cleanser is of utmost importance for the longevity of a healthy, acne-and-wrinkle-free skin along with some other anti-aging products especially if you put on heavy make-up very frequently.\r\n\r\nCleanser should be used twice a day, before and after sleep, because the skin gets affected from pollutants every day even within few hours and most cleansers are not harsh on skin.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on cleansers, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of cleansers soon for my beauty supply.\r\n\r\n2. <strong>Exfoliator</strong>\r\nAn exfoliator is basically like a soap or cream or lotion with granular particles in it which is applied or rubbed on the face and then washed off. It is used to remove dead and coarse skin cells from the face to make the skin smooth and soft.\r\n\r\nGentle or light exfoliator should be used once a day. However, since most exfoliators are not gentle, they should not be used more than once or twice a week.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on exfoliators, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of exfoliators soon for my beauty supply.\r\n\r\n3. <strong>Serum</strong>\r\nSerums are like moisturizers that provide active ingredients, antioxidants, hydrators and anti-inflammatories to the skin to keep it healthy and reduce its aging, wrinkles, and fine lines. Serums are quite concentrated and you have to be careful in using them, which I will cover in future articles. Serums are not necessary for a skin care regimen. However, if your skin has less problems, you have to wear less make-up to cover it up. Serums make your skin look healthier, radiant, younger and fresher. However, if you are suffering from Rosacea or eczema, you should avoid using a serum as it may cause aggravation.\r\n\r\nSerums should be used twice a day on regular basis. In the morning, the layer of sunscreen should be applied over the layer of serum, while at night a layer of moisturizer should be applied over the layer of serum.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on serums, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of serums soon for my beauty supply.\r\n\r\n4.<strong> Moisturizer</strong>\r\nMoisturizer is basically used to make the outer skin softer, smoother and more elastic, and to remove dryness through reducing evaporation. It contains natural or artificial oils, natural skin lipids and sterols, plant extracts, lubricants etc.\r\n\r\nMoisturizer should be used once or twice a day. But avoid using too much moisturizer at once as it could be more damaging than being healthy. Also, its important for you to know what type of ingredients your skin needs in a perfect moisturizer amongst the thousands that are available. Changing the type of moisturizer as your skin changes during various seasons of the year is also important. I have created another article to cover all such issues. I will be covering more details on moisturizers, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of moisturizers soon.\r\n\r\nSome of my favorite moisturizers are:\r\n(i) Cetaphil Daily Moisturizer, which works well for me as well as many of my friends with normal or even excessively dry or super oily skin.\r\n(ii) Aveeno Natural Radiance, which is not as good but has thinner constituency and so its absorbed into the skin quickly, and it does make the skin look radiant indeed.\r\n\r\n5. <strong>Eye Cream</strong>\r\nSome people tend to not give special importance or any kind of priority to the skin surrounding the eyes. They feel that the other facial products will also take care of the eye skin. Besides, the eye creams are usually more expensive than other facial products. However, whether or not the eye cream fits in your budget, whether or not eye creams seem important to you, you should know a few things about why they exist at all.\r\n\r\nThe skin surrounding the eyes is more sensitive and fragile as compared to other areas, and its needs are totally different which regular facial products cannot fulfill. The skin around the eyes tends to age quicker, and is more prone to dryness and fatigue, thus forming dark circles easily. The eye cream is specifically designed to handle such issues by providing the area with proper elements that it needs most. I will be covering on eye creams in future articles for my beauty supply.\r\n\r\nWhether or not you want to focus on eye cream is upto you. However, if you do get one, you should use it once or twice a day. If you use once a day, use it at night.\r\n\r\n6. <strong>Foundation Or Tinted Moisturizer</strong>\r\nSo far we were only discussing about the products for our skin care regimen. Foundation is the first actual product from our beauty supply kit (or our makeup kit :P). Foundation is a skin-tinting pigment used to cover skin flaws and create a uniform complexion, or to change the color-tone of natural complexion. Foundation can be liquid or powder. Liquid foundation can be dewy or matte, while powder foundation can be illuminating or matte. If you suffer from dry skin or rosacea, try avoiding the powder and go for liquid, because powder will affect your skin negatively in long run. If you have oily skin, try to avoid dewy finish using a mix of liquid and powder foundations. I will be covering in future articles more on how to select and apply foundation.\r\n\r\nSome people have a misconception that tint-moisturizer is another skin care cream similar to other regular moisturizers or serums. However, when you match the ingredients of a foundation to those of a tint-moisturizer, you will notice striking similarities, such as use of solvent, mixtures of humectants and emollients, surfactants to keep the emulsion-type products mixed in a creamy base, ingredients to control the pH and thickness, skin toning pigments such as iron-oxide, titanium dioxide and mica, as well as preservatives to keep the product sanitized.\r\n\r\nSo a tint-moisturizer is basically a foundation. However, its a mild form of foundation since the amount of pigments used are usually less as compared to a foundation. Also, a tint-moisturizer hydrates skin better than a foundation due to higher concentration of humectants. Some brands’ foundation may act the same way as another brands’ tint-moisturizer though. So the two types of products vary a lot from brand to brand. You will have to figure out which type and brand works well for you depending on your preferences, skin type and season. But you definitely don’t need both products.\r\n\r\nIt should be obvious by now that tinted moisturizer shouldn’t be treated as a part of skin care regimen. Stay tuned on my beauty supply for more about foundations and tinted moisturizers.\r\n\r\n7. <strong>Concealer</strong>\r\nWhile foundation is used to even out the skin tone across your face, concealer is used to hide zits, dark circles or scars. In some cases, foundation is able to hide what you are trying to hide, but if it doesn’t, use a concealer. Concealer usually goes on top of foundation, if both concealer and foundation are used. However, if you are not wearing any make up and just need to hide the marks, you can use just concealer without any layer of foundation.\r\n\r\nI will be covering detailed tips in future articles on how to use concealers like a professional.\r\n\r\n8. <strong>Blush and Bronzer</strong>\r\nBlush, also called rouge, is used to redden the cheeks. Bronzer gives a suntan appearance to the skin, and contours and highlights the cheekbone. Sometimes, the application of blush and bronzer can amazingly change the features of the face.\r\n\r\nBronzer is usually applied before blush. There are several different types of blushes and bronzers. I will be writing more articles for my beauty supply on how to pick the right one for your skin and how to apply them.\r\n\r\n9. <strong>Eyeshadow and Eyeliner</strong>\r\nEye shadow is used to highlight or draw attention to the eyes, or to make them look attractive. It is applied on the upper eyelids, and sometimes even on the lower eyelids, and under the eyebrows. Different colors and different types of eye shadow provide difference look and feel. There are matte, liquid and shimmer and several other types. Shimmer is used for sexy look usually in parties, while matte is used for plain looks for more professional settings. I will be adding more information in future articles on how to choose the right type of eyeshadow and how to apply them here.\r\n\r\nEyeliner is used to emphasize or change the shape of the eye. The difference between eye shadow and eyeliner is that eye shadow is used recreate and design the frame of the eye as well as to throw in some colors, whereas the eyeliner is used only to change the shape of the eye. Eyeliner is applied close to contours or rim of the eye, while the eye shadow is applied in more outer areas as well. You can use either an eyeshadow or eyeliner, or even a combination of both during your makeup depending on your preferences. Usually lighter eyeliners provide better and more open looks to the eyes. I will be compiling another article to go deeper in this.\r\n\r\n10. <strong>Mascara</strong>\r\nMascara is used for thickening, coloring, enhancing, curling or even lengthening the eyelashes. It comes in various forms primarily liquid, cream and cake (or powder). It is important to choose the right type of mascara for the right occasion and duration. Most mascaras come with an applicator, but since there are so many different types of applicators available for applying mascara on eyelashes, you can get a specific type according to your preference. I will be adding a detailed article on how to pick the right mascara and an applicator, and how to apply it on eyelashes.\r\n\r\n11. <strong>Brow Pencil</strong>\r\nA brow pencil is like a regular pencil with makeup instead of lead. It is used to enhance the shape of eyebrow, to thicken it, or to lengthen it, or broaden it up. Some people even remove or wax the entire eyebrows before drawing completely new ones from with the brow pencil, may be because they don’t like their eyebrows or may be they just want to try something new. Brow pencil comes in various types and colors. A pencil may have a thick end or a pointy end. Pointy-ended pencil is used to define details and outlines, while thick-ended pencil is used for applying makeup in large, base areas. In addition to the pencil, usually a brow pencil kit also contains tweezers to remove any stray hair, as well as a brow brush or comb to arrange the hair strands.\r\n\r\nI will be adding a more detailed article soon for my beauty supply on how to choose and use a brow pencil kit.\r\n\r\n12. <strong>Lipstick and Lip Gloss</strong>\r\nLipstick is like a wax applied on lips to change their color and texture to make the face look more attractive. Some lipsticks provide protection to lips as well in a similar way as lip balms.\r\n\r\nLip gloss is used to provide a lustrous or shiny finish and sometime a subtle color to the lips. They can have various types of metallic, glittery, frosted or glossy finishes.\r\n\r\nLipstick is usually applied for parties as well as formal settings, while lip gloss generally for parties, weekends and late nights. There are many more points about lipsticks and lip gloss that need to be covered. Stay tuned on my beauty supply.\r\n\r\n13. <strong>Nail Polish</strong>\r\nNail polish or paint is used to color the nails. Most of the time the terms nail polish and nail paint are used interchangeably. However, some people prefer to call nail paint for the matte color while a nail polish for the lustrous or shiny color. This difference in terms is usually created by the brands and manufacturers. A nail paint gives an attractive look to the nails and is an important mark of makeup. Many women these days make creative designs on their nails using nail paints of different color instead of simply painting all the nails with one color. Since nail paints cannot be removed by simply by washing them, a special product called nail paint remover comes separate to assist with this task.\r\n\r\nI will be covering nails in more detail soon.\r\n\r\n14. <strong>Perfume</strong>\r\nPerfume is the last but most important part of this beauty supply article to complete our makeup kit. Perfume is a spray used to give a pleasant smell to the body. A make up seems to be incomplete without a good perfume. Once again, there are a variety of perfumes for different occasions that you can get. Not all perfumes go well on every personality. You have to experiment with several of them to see which one suits your personality. There are many tips and advises about perfumes that I will be covering in future articles.', 'Beauty Supply That A Girl Should Have In Stock', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'beauty-supply-girl-stock', '', '', '2016-03-09 03:08:10', '2016-03-09 03:08:10', '', 0, 'http://localhost:8080/femina/?p=4', 0, 'post', '', 0),

There are many more points about lipsticks and lip gloss that need to be covered which you can find here. &lt;LINK&gt;\r\n\r\n13. <strong>Nail Polish</strong>\r\n\r\nNail polish or paint is used to color the nails. Most of the time the terms nail polish and nail paint are used interchangeably, but some people prefer to call nail paint for the matte color while a nail polish for the lustrous or shiny color. This difference in terms is usually created by the brands and manufacturers. A nail paint gives an attractive look to the nails and is an important mark of makeup. Many women these days make creative designs on their nails using nail paints of different color instead of simply painting all the nails with one color. Since nail paints cannot be removed by simply by washing them, a special product called nail paint remover comes separate to assist with this task.\r\n\r\nI have covered nails in more detail here. &lt;LINK&gt;\r\n\r\n14. <strong>Perfume</strong>\r\nPerfume is the last but most important part of this beauty supply article to complete our makeup kit.

(6, 1, '2016-03-09 03:07:20', '2016-03-09 03:07:20', '&nbsp;\n\nLooking pretty and attractive at a party is essential for every girl. For that, she needs to have a perfect make-up kit among other priorities. However, when choosing the beauty or make up products you should keep in mind the long term effects its going to cause on your skin. You should use the skin care products along with make-up products as a precautionary measure to reduce the chances of spoiling your skin. Also, while shopping at a store, some girls find it hard to pick products at the cosmetics section. In this article, I have created a list of beauty supply that a girl should have to complete her makeup and skin care kit.\n\nFurthermore, I will be writing articles progressively and posting them on this website to provide ladies with tips, tricks and guidance on how to properly use their makeup kits and use different cosmetics for different purposes like a pro. I will be comparing different products from all types of cosmetics from our beauty supply list so that the girls can make better choice on which product and brand to use or try.\n\nI will also be making efforts to find and recommend the right places, stores, companies or people to get the cheapest but good quality products for the users of this website so that they can afford to look attractive.\n\nYou can follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, etc.\n\n1. <strong>Cleanser</strong>\nA cleanser is used to wash away make-up, dirt, pollutants, oil and other impurities from the surface of the skin. Its a better alternative to bar soap and other skin cleansers because of various reasons such as:\n(i) Skin pH is about 4.7 where as soap has a high pH between 9-10, which can imbalance the skin pH thus causing further growth of bacteria increasing acne.\n(ii) Bar soap contains thickeners which clog up skin pores causing acne.\n(iii) Bar soap on the face removes natural oil which in turn causes sebaceous glands to overproduce oils causing acne. For these reasons, a facial cleanser is recommended instead of a soap to wash the face with. Usually, a cleanser is used as a part of skin care regimen in combination with a toner and a moisturizer.\n\nA cleanser is of utmost importance for the longevity of a healthy, acne-and-wrinkle-free skin along with some other anti-aging products especially if you put on heavy make-up very frequently.\n\nCleanser should be used twice a day, before and after sleep, because the skin gets affected from pollutants every day even within few hours and most cleansers are not harsh on skin.\n\nI will be covering more details on cleansers, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of cleansers soon for my beauty supply.\n\n2. <strong>Exfoliator</strong>\nAn exfoliator is basically like a soap or cream or lotion with granular particles in it which is applied or rubbed on the face and then washed off. It is used to remove dead and coarse skin cells from the face to make the skin smooth and soft.\n\nGentle or light exfoliator should be used once a day. However, since most exfoliators are not gentle, they should not be used more than once or twice a week.\n\nI will be covering more details on exfoliators, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of exfoliators soon for my beauty supply.\n\n3. <strong>Serum</strong>\nSerums are like moisturizers that provide active ingredients, antioxidants, hydrators and anti-inflammatories to the skin to keep it healthy and reduce its aging, wrinkles, and fine lines. Serums are quite concentrated and you have to be careful in using them, which I will cover in future articles. Serums are not necessary for a skin care regimen. However, if your skin has less problems, you have to wear less make-up to cover it up. Serums make your skin look healthier, radiant, younger and fresher. However, if you are suffering from Rosacea or eczema, you should avoid using a serum as it may cause aggravation.\n\nSerums should be used twice a day on regular basis. In the morning, the layer of sunscreen should be applied over the layer of serum, while at night a layer of moisturizer should be applied over the layer of serum.\n\nI will be covering more details on serums, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of serums soon for my beauty supply.\n\n4.<strong> Moisturizer</strong>\nMoisturizer is basically used to make the outer skin softer, smoother and more elastic, and to remove dryness through reducing evaporation. It contains natural or artificial oils, natural skin lipids and sterols, plant extracts, lubricants etc.\n\nMoisturizer should be used once or twice a day. But avoid using too much moisturizer at once as it could be more damaging than being healthy. Also, its important for you to know what type of ingredients your skin needs in a perfect moisturizer amongst the thousands that are available. Changing the type of moisturizer as your skin changes during various seasons of the year is also important. I have created another article to cover all such issues. I will be covering more details on moisturizers, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of moisturizers soon.\n\nSome of my favorite moisturizers are:\n(i) Cetaphil Daily Moisturizer, which works well for me as well as many of my friends with normal or even excessively dry or super oily skin.\n(ii) Aveeno Natural Radiance, which is not as good but has thinner constituency and so its absorbed into the skin quickly, and it does make the skin look radiant indeed.\n\n5. <strong>Eye Cream</strong>\nSome people tend to not give special importance or any kind of priority to the skin surrounding the eyes. They feel that the other facial products will also take care of the eye skin. Besides, the eye creams are usually more expensive than other facial products. However, whether or not the eye cream fits in your budget, whether or not eye creams seem important to you, you should know a few things about why they exist at all.\n\nThe skin surrounding the eyes is more sensitive and fragile as compared to other areas, and its needs are totally different which regular facial products cannot fulfill. The skin around the eyes tends to age quicker, and is more prone to dryness and fatigue, thus forming dark circles easily. The eye cream is specifically designed to handle such issues by providing the area with proper elements that it needs most. I will be covering on eye creams in future articles for my beauty supply.\n\nWhether or not you want to focus on eye cream is upto you. However, if you do get one, you should use it once or twice a day. If you use once a day, use it at night.\n\n6. <strong>Foundation Or Tinted Moisturizer</strong>\nSo far we were only discussing about the products for our skin care regimen. Foundation is the first actual product from our beauty supply kit (or our makeup kit :P). Foundation is a skin-tinting pigment used to cover skin flaws and create a uniform complexion, or to change the color-tone of natural complexion. Foundation can be liquid or powder. Liquid foundation can be dewy or matte, while powder foundation can be illuminating or matte. If you suffer from dry skin or rosacea, try avoiding the powder and go for liquid, because powder will affect your skin negatively in long run. If you have oily skin, try to avoid dewy finish using a mix of liquid and powder foundations. I will be covering in future articles more on how to select and apply foundation.\n\nSome people have a misconception that tint-moisturizer is another skin care cream similar to other regular moisturizers or serums. However, when you match the ingredients of a foundation to those of a tint-moisturizer, you will notice striking similarities, such as use of solvent, mixtures of humectants and emollients, surfactants to keep the emulsion-type products mixed in a creamy base, ingredients to control the pH and thickness, skin toning pigments such as iron-oxide, titanium dioxide and mica, as well as preservatives to keep the product sanitized.\n\nSo a tint-moisturizer is basically a foundation. However, its a mild form of foundation since the amount of pigments used are usually less as compared to a foundation. Also, a tint-moisturizer hydrates skin better than a foundation due to higher concentration of humectants. Some brands’ foundation may act the same way as another brands’ tint-moisturizer though. So the two types of products vary a lot from brand to brand. You will have to figure out which type and brand works well for you depending on your preferences, skin type and season. But you definitely don’t need both products.\n\nIt should be obvious by now that tinted moisturizer shouldn’t be treated as a part of skin care regimen. Stay tuned on my beauty supply for more about foundations and tinted moisturizers.\n\n7. <strong>Concealer</strong>\nWhile foundation is used to even out the skin tone across your face, concealer is used to hide zits, dark circles or scars. In some cases, foundation is able to hide what you are trying to hide, but if it doesn’t, use a concealer. Concealer usually goes on top of foundation, if both concealer and foundation are used. However, if you are not wearing any make up and just need to hide the marks, you can use just concealer without any layer of foundation.\n\nI will be covering detailed tips in future articles on how to use concealers like a professional.\n\n8. <strong>Blush and Bronzer</strong>\nBlush, also called rouge, is used to redden the cheeks. Bronzer gives a suntan appearance to the skin, and contours and highlights the cheekbone. Sometimes, the application of blush and bronzer can amazingly change the features of the face.\n\nBronzer is usually applied before blush. There are several different types of blushes and bronzers. I will be writing more articles for my beauty supply on how to pick the right one for your skin and how to apply them.\n\n9. <strong>Eyeshadow and Eyeliner</strong>\nEye shadow is used to highlight or draw attention to the eyes, or to make them look attractive. It is applied on the upper eyelids, and sometimes even on the lower eyelids, and under the eyebrows. Different colors and different types of eye shadow provide difference look and feel. There are matte, liquid and shimmer and several other types. Shimmer is used for sexy look usually in parties, while matte is used for plain looks for more professional settings. I will be adding more information in future articles on how to choose the right type of eyeshadow and how to apply them here.\n\nEyeliner is used to emphasize or change the shape of the eye. The difference between eye shadow and eyeliner is that eye shadow is used recreate and design the frame of the eye as well as to throw in some colors, whereas the eyeliner is used only to change the shape of the eye. Eyeliner is applied close to contours or rim of the eye, while the eye shadow is applied in more outer areas as well. You can use either an eyeshadow or eyeliner, or even a combination of both during your makeup depending on your preferences. Usually lighter eyeliners provide better and more open looks to the eyes. I will be compiling another article to go deeper in this.\n\n10. <strong>Mascara</strong>\nMascara is used for thickening, coloring, enhancing, curling or even lengthening the eyelashes. It comes in various forms primarily liquid, cream and cake (or powder). It is important to choose the right type of mascara for the right occasion and duration. Most mascaras come with an applicator, but since there are so many different types of applicators available for applying mascara on eyelashes, you can get a specific type according to your preference. I will be adding a detailed article on how to pick the right mascara and an applicator, and how to apply it on eyelashes.\n\n11. <strong>Brow Pencil</strong>\nA brow pencil is like a regular pencil with makeup instead of lead. It is used to enhance the shape of eyebrow, to thicken it, or to lengthen it, or broaden it up. Some people even remove or wax the entire eyebrows before drawing completely new ones from with the brow pencil, may be because they don’t like their eyebrows or may be they just want to try something new. Brow pencil comes in various types and colors. A pencil may have a thick end or a pointy end. Pointy-ended pencil is used to define details and outlines, while thick-ended pencil is used for applying makeup in large, base areas. In addition to the pencil, usually a brow pencil kit also contains tweezers to remove any stray hair, as well as a brow brush or comb to arrange the hair strands.\n\nI will be adding a more detailed article soon for my beauty supply on how to choose and use a brow pencil kit.\n\n12. <strong>Lipstick and Lip Gloss</strong>\nLipstick is like a wax applied on lips to change their color and texture to make the face look more attractive. Some lipsticks provide protection to lips as well in a similar way as lip balms.\n\nLip gloss is used to provide a lustrous or shiny finish and sometime a subtle color to the lips. They can have various types of metallic, glittery, frosted or glossy finishes.\n\nLipstick is usually applied for parties as well as formal settings, while lip gloss generally for parties, weekends and late nights. There are many more points about lipsticks and lip gloss that need to be covered. Stay tuned on my beauty supply.\n\n13. <strong>Nail Polish</strong>\nNail polish or paint is used to color the nails. Most of the time the terms nail polish and nail paint are used interchangeably.

However, when choosing the beauty or make up products you should keep in mind the long term effects its going to cause on your skin. You should use the skin care products along with make-up products as a precautionary measure to reduce the chances of spoiling your skin. Also, while shopping at a store, some girls find it hard to pick products at the cosmetics section. In this article, I have created a list of beauty supply that a girl should have to complete her makeup and skin care kit.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I will be writing articles progressively and posting them on this website to provide ladies with tips, tricks and guidance on how to properly use their makeup kits and use different cosmetics for different purposes like a pro. I will be comparing different products from all types of cosmetics from our beauty supply list so that the girls can make better choice on which product and brand to use or try.\r\n\r\nI will also be making efforts to find and recommend the right places, stores, companies or people to get the cheapest but good quality products for the users of this website so that they can afford to look attractive.\r\n\r\nYou can follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, etc.\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Cleanser</strong>\r\nA cleanser is used to wash away make-up, dirt, pollutants, oil and other impurities from the surface of the skin. Its a better alternative to bar soap and other skin cleansers because of various reasons such as, (i) skin pH is about 4.7 where as soap has a high pH between 9-10, which can imbalance the skin pH thus causing further growth of bacteria increasing acne, (ii) bar soap contains thickeners which clog up skin pores causing acne, and (iii) bar soap on the face removes natural oil which in turn causes sebaceous glands to overproduce oils causing acne. For these reasons, a facial cleanser is recommended instead of a soap to wash the face with. Usually, a cleanser is used as a part of skin care regimen in combination with a toner and a moisturizer.\r\n\r\nA cleanser is of utmost importance for the longevity of a healthy, acne-and-wrinkle-free skin along with some other anti-aging products especially if you put on heavy make-up very frequently.\r\n\r\nCleanser should be used twice a day, before and after sleep, because the skin gets affected from pollutants every day even within few hours and most cleansers are not harsh on skin.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on cleansers, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of cleansers soon.

It is used to remove dead and coarse skin cells from the face to make the skin smooth and soft.\r\n\r\nGentle or light exfoliator should be used once a day. However, since most exfoliators are not gentle, they should not be used more than once or twice a week.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on exfoliators, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of exfoliators soon. Subscribe if you want to get notification on future articles.\r\n\r\n3. <strong>Serum</strong>\r\n\r\nSerums are like moisturizers that provide active ingredients, antioxidants, hydrators and anti-inflammatories to the skin to keep it healthy and reduce its aging, wrinkles, and fine lines. Serums are quite concentrated and you have to be careful in using them, which I will cover in future articles. Serums are not necessary for a skin care regimen. However, if your skin has less problems, you have to wear less make-up to cover it up. Serums make your skin look healthier, radiant, younger and fresher. However, if you are suffering from Rosacea or eczema, you should avoid using a serum as it may cause aggravation.\r\n\r\nSerums should be used twice a day on regular basis. In the morning, the layer of sunscreen should be applied over the layer of serum, while at night a layer of moisturizer should be applied over the layer of serum.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on serums, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of serums soon. Subscribe if you want to get notification on future articles.\r\n\r\n4.<strong> Moisturizer</strong>\r\nMoisturizer is basically used to make the outer skin softer, smoother and more elastic, and to remove dryness through reducing evaporation. It contains natural or artificial oils, natural skin lipids and sterols, plant extracts, lubricants etc.\r\n\r\nMoisturizer should be used once or twice a day. But avoid using too much moisturizer at once as it could be more damaging than being healthy. Also, its important for you to know what type of ingredients your skin needs in a perfect moisturizer amongst the thousands that are available. Changing the type of moisturizer as your skin changes during various seasons of the year is also important. I have created another article to cover all such issues. &lt;LINK&gt;\r\n\r\nSome of my favorite moisturizers are (i) Cetaphil Daily Moisturizer, which works well for me as well as many of my friends with normal or even excessively dry or super oily skin, and (ii) Aveeno Natural Radiance, which is not as good but has thinner constituency and so its absorbed into the skin quickly, and it does make the skin look radiant indeed.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on moisturizers, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of moisturizers soon. Subscribe if you want to get notification on future articles.\r\n\r\n5. <strong>Eye Cream</strong>\r\nSome people tend to not give special importance or any kind of priority to the skin surrounding the eyes. They feel that the other facial products will also take care of the eye skin. Besides, the eye creams are usually more expensive than other facial products. However, whether or not the eye cream fits in your budget, whether or not eye creams seem important to you, you should know a few things about why they exist at all.\r\n\r\nThe skin surrounding the eyes is more sensitive and fragile as compared to other areas, and its needs are totally different which regular facial products cannot fulfill. The skin around the eyes tends to age quicker, and is more prone to dryness and fatigue, thus forming dark circles easily. The eye cream is specifically designed to handle such issues by providing the area with proper elements that it needs most. You can find more in depth information here. &lt;LINK&gt;\r\n\r\nWhether or not you want to focus on eye cream is upto you. However, if you do want it, you should use it once or twice a day. If you use once a day, use it at night.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on eye creams, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of eye creams soon.

Foundation is the first actual product from our beauty supply kit (or our makeup kit :P). Foundation is a skin-tinting pigment used to cover skin flaws and create a uniform complexion, or to change the color-tone of natural complexion. Foundation can be liquid or powder. Liquid foundation can be dewy or matte, while powder foundation can be illuminating or matte. If you suffer from dry skin or rosacea, try avoiding the powder and go for liquid, because powder will affect your skin negatively in long run. If you have oily skin, try to avoid dewy finish using a mix of liquid and powder foundations. Visit here to get more detailed information on how to select and apply foundation. &lt;LINK&gt;\r\n\r\nSome people have a misconception that tint-moisturizer is another skin care cream similar to other regular moisturizers or serums. However, when you match the ingredients of a foundation to those of a tint-moisturizer, you will notice striking similarities, such as use of solvent, mixtures of humectants and emollients, surfactants to keep the emulsion-type products mixed in a creamy base, ingredients to control the pH and thickness, skin toning pigments such as iron-oxide, titanium dioxide and mica, as well as preservatives to keep the product sanitized.\r\n\r\nSo a tint-moisturizer is basically a foundation. However, its a mild form of foundation since the amount of pigments used are usually less as compared to a foundation. Also, a tint-moisturizer hydrates skin better than a foundation due to higher concentration of humectants. Some brands’ foundation may act the same way as another brands’ tint-moisturizer though. So the two types of products vary a lot from brand to brand. You will have to figure out which type and brand works well for you depending on your preferences, skin type and season. But you definitely don’t need both products.\r\n\r\nIt should be obvious by now that tinted moisturizer shouldn’t be treated as a part of skin care regimen.

In some cases, foundation is able to hide what you are trying to hide, but if it doesn’t, use a concealer. Concealer usually goes on top of foundation, if both concealer and foundation are used. However, if you are not wearing any make up and just need to hide the marks, you can use just concealer without any layer of foundation.\r\n\r\nGo here for tips on how to use concealer like a professional. &lt;LINK&gt;\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on concealers, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of concealers soon.

Bronzer gives a suntan appearance to the skin, and contours and highlights the cheekbone.

There are several different types of blushes and bronzers. Visit this &lt;LINK&gt; to find out more on how to pick the right one for your skin and how to apply them.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on blushes, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of blushes soon.

It is applied on the upper eyelids, and sometimes even on the lower eyelids, and under the eyebrows. Different colors and different types of eye shadow provide difference look and feel. There are matte, liquid and shimmer and several other types. Shimmer is used for sexy look usually in parties, while matte is used for plain looks for more professional settings. Find out how to choose the right type of eyeshadow and how to apply them here. &lt;LINK&gt;\r\n\r\nEyeliner is used to emphasize or change the shape of the eye. The difference between eye shadow and eyeliner is that eye shadow is used recreate and design the frame of the eye as well as to throw in some colors, whereas the eyeliner is used only to change the shape of the eye. Eyeliner is applied close to contours or rim of the eye, while the eye shadow is applied in more outer areas as well. You can use either an eyeshadow or eyeliner, or even a combination of both during your makeup depending on your preferences. Usually lighter eyeliners provide better and more open looks to the eyes. I have compiled another article to go deeper in this. &lt;LINK&gt;\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on eye shadows and eyeliners, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of eye shadows and liners soon.

It comes in various forms primarily liquid, cream and cake (or powder). It is important to choose the right type of mascara for the right occasion and duration. Most mascaras come with an applicator, but since there are so many different types of applicators available for applying mascara on eyelashes, you can get a specific type according to your preference. Here is a detailed article on how to pick the right mascara and an applicator, and how to apply it on eyelashes. &lt;LINK&gt;\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on mascaras, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of mascaras soon.

It is used to enhance the shape of eyebrow, to thicken it, or to lengthen it, or broaden it up. Some people even remove or wax the entire eyebrows before drawing completely new ones from with the brow pencil, may be because they don’t like their eyebrows or may be they just want to try something new. Brow pencil comes in various types and colors. A pencil may have a thick end or a pointy end. Pointy-ended pencil is used to define details and outlines, while thick-ended pencil is used for applying makeup in large, base areas. In addition to the pencil, usually a brow pencil kit also contains tweezers to remove any stray hair, as well as a brow brush or comb to arrange the hair strands.\r\n\r\nHere is more detailed article on how to choose and use a brow pencil kit. &lt;LINK&gt;\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on brow pencils, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of eye creams soon.

Some lipsticks provide protection to lips as well in a similar way as lip balms.\r\n\r\nLip gloss is used to provide a lustrous or shiny finish and sometime a subtle color to the lips. They can have various types of metallic, glittery, frosted or glossy finishes.\r\n\r\nLipstick is usually applied for parties as well as formal settings, while lip gloss generally for parties, weekends and late nights.

Some lipsticks provide protection to lips as well in a similar way as lip balms.\r\n\r\nLip gloss is used to provide a lustrous or shiny finish and sometime a subtle color to the lips. They can have various types of metallic, glittery, frosted or glossy finishes.\r\n\r\nLipstick is usually applied for parties as well as formal settings, while lip gloss generally for parties, weekends and late nights.

Perfume is a spray used to give a pleasant smell to the body. A make up seems to be incomplete without a good perfume. Once again, there are a variety of perfumes for different occasions that you can get. Not all perfumes go well on every personality and you have to experiment with several of them to see which one suits your personality.

However, when choosing the beauty or make up products you should keep in mind the long term effects its going to cause on your skin. You should use the skin care products along with make-up products as a precautionary measure to reduce the chances of spoiling your skin. Also, while shopping at a store, some girls find it hard to pick products at the cosmetics section. In this article, I have created a list of beauty supply that a girl should have to complete her makeup and skin care kit.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I will be writing articles progressively and posting them on this website to provide ladies with tips, tricks and guidance on how to properly use their makeup kits and use different cosmetics for different purposes like a pro. I will be comparing different products from all types of cosmetics from our beauty supply list so that the girls can make better choice on which product and brand to use or try.\r\n\r\nI will also be making efforts to find and recommend the right places, stores, companies or people to get the cheapest but good quality products for the users of this website so that they can afford to look attractive.\r\n\r\nYou can follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, etc.\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Cleanser</strong>\r\nA cleanser is used to wash away make-up, dirt, pollutants, oil and other impurities from the surface of the skin. Its a better alternative to bar soap and other skin cleansers because of various reasons such as, (i) skin pH is about 4.7 where as soap has a high pH between 9-10, which can imbalance the skin pH thus causing further growth of bacteria increasing acne, (ii) bar soap contains thickeners which clog up skin pores causing acne, and (iii) bar soap on the face removes natural oil which in turn causes sebaceous glands to overproduce oils causing acne. For these reasons, a facial cleanser is recommended instead of a soap to wash the face with. Usually, a cleanser is used as a part of skin care regimen in combination with a toner and a moisturizer.\r\n\r\nA cleanser is of utmost importance for the longevity of a healthy, acne-and-wrinkle-free skin along with some other anti-aging products especially if you put on heavy make-up very frequently.\r\n\r\nCleanser should be used twice a day, before and after sleep, because the skin gets affected from pollutants every day even within few hours and most cleansers are not harsh on skin.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on cleansers, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of cleansers soon.\r\n\r\n2. <strong>Exfoliator</strong>\r\nAn exfoliator is basically like a soap or cream or lotion with granular particles in it which is applied or rubbed on the face and then washed off. It is used to remove dead and coarse skin cells from the face to make the skin smooth and soft.\r\n\r\nGentle or light exfoliator should be used once a day. However, since most exfoliators are not gentle, they should not be used more than once or twice a week.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on exfoliators, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of exfoliators soon.\r\n\r\n3. <strong>Serum</strong>\r\n\r\nSerums are like moisturizers that provide active ingredients, antioxidants, hydrators and anti-inflammatories to the skin to keep it healthy and reduce its aging, wrinkles, and fine lines. Serums are quite concentrated and you have to be careful in using them, which I will cover in future articles. Serums are not necessary for a skin care regimen. However, if your skin has less problems, you have to wear less make-up to cover it up. Serums make your skin look healthier, radiant, younger and fresher. However, if you are suffering from Rosacea or eczema, you should avoid using a serum as it may cause aggravation.\r\n\r\nSerums should be used twice a day on regular basis. In the morning, the layer of sunscreen should be applied over the layer of serum, while at night a layer of moisturizer should be applied over the layer of serum.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on serums, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of serums soon.\r\n\r\n4.<strong> Moisturizer</strong>\r\nMoisturizer is basically used to make the outer skin softer, smoother and more elastic, and to remove dryness through reducing evaporation. It contains natural or artificial oils, natural skin lipids and sterols, plant extracts, lubricants etc.\r\n\r\nMoisturizer should be used once or twice a day. But avoid using too much moisturizer at once as it could be more damaging than being healthy. Also, its important for you to know what type of ingredients your skin needs in a perfect moisturizer amongst the thousands that are available. Changing the type of moisturizer as your skin changes during various seasons of the year is also important. I have created another article to cover all such issues. I will be covering more details on moisturizers, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of moisturizers soon.\r\n\r\nSome of my favorite moisturizers are (i) Cetaphil Daily Moisturizer, which works well for me as well as many of my friends with normal or even excessively dry or super oily skin, and (ii) Aveeno Natural Radiance, which is not as good but has thinner constituency and so its absorbed into the skin quickly, and it does make the skin look radiant indeed.\r\n\r\n5. <strong>Eye Cream</strong>\r\nSome people tend to not give special importance or any kind of priority to the skin surrounding the eyes. They feel that the other facial products will also take care of the eye skin. Besides, the eye creams are usually more expensive than other facial products. However, whether or not the eye cream fits in your budget, whether or not eye creams seem important to you, you should know a few things about why they exist at all.\r\n\r\nThe skin surrounding the eyes is more sensitive and fragile as compared to other areas, and its needs are totally different which regular facial products cannot fulfill. The skin around the eyes tends to age quicker, and is more prone to dryness and fatigue, thus forming dark circles easily. The eye cream is specifically designed to handle such issues by providing the area with proper elements that it needs most. I will be covering on eye creams in future articles.\r\n\r\nWhether or not you want to focus on eye cream is upto you. However, if you do get one, you should use it once or twice a day. If you use once a day, use it at night.\r\n\r\n6. <strong>Foundation Or Tinted Moisturizer</strong>\r\nSo far we were only discussing about the products for our skin care regimen. Foundation is the first actual product from our beauty supply kit (or our makeup kit :P). Foundation is a skin-tinting pigment used to cover skin flaws and create a uniform complexion, or to change the color-tone of natural complexion. Foundation can be liquid or powder. Liquid foundation can be dewy or matte, while powder foundation can be illuminating or matte. If you suffer from dry skin or rosacea, try avoiding the powder and go for liquid, because powder will affect your skin negatively in long run. If you have oily skin, try to avoid dewy finish using a mix of liquid and powder foundations. I will be covering in future articles more on how to select and apply foundation.\r\n\r\nSome people have a misconception that tint-moisturizer is another skin care cream similar to other regular moisturizers or serums. However, when you match the ingredients of a foundation to those of a tint-moisturizer, you will notice striking similarities, such as use of solvent, mixtures of humectants and emollients, surfactants to keep the emulsion-type products mixed in a creamy base, ingredients to control the pH and thickness, skin toning pigments such as iron-oxide, titanium dioxide and mica, as well as preservatives to keep the product sanitized.\r\n\r\nSo a tint-moisturizer is basically a foundation. However, its a mild form of foundation since the amount of pigments used are usually less as compared to a foundation. Also, a tint-moisturizer hydrates skin better than a foundation due to higher concentration of humectants. Some brands’ foundation may act the same way as another brands’ tint-moisturizer though. So the two types of products vary a lot from brand to brand. You will have to figure out which type and brand works well for you depending on your preferences, skin type and season. But you definitely don’t need both products.\r\n\r\nIt should be obvious by now that tinted moisturizer shouldn’t be treated as a part of skin care regimen. Stay tuned for more about foundations and tinted moisturizers.\r\n\r\n7. <strong>Concealer</strong>\r\nWhile foundation is used to even out the skin tone across your face, concealer is used to hide zits, dark circles or scars. In some cases, foundation is able to hide what you are trying to hide, but if it doesn’t, use a concealer. Concealer usually goes on top of foundation, if both concealer and foundation are used. However, if you are not wearing any make up and just need to hide the marks, you can use just concealer without any layer of foundation.\r\n\r\nGo here for tips on how to use concealer like a professional. &lt;LINK&gt;\r\n\r\nI will be covering detailed tips in future articles on how to use concealers like a professional.\r\n\r\n8. <strong>Blush and Bronzer</strong>\r\nBlush, also called rouge, is used to redden the cheeks. Bronzer gives a suntan appearance to the skin, and contours and highlights the cheekbone. Sometimes, the application of blush and bronzer can amazingly change the features of the face.\r\n\r\nBronzer is usually applied before blush. There are several different types of blushes and bronzers. I will be writing more articles on how to pick the right one for your skin and how to apply them.\r\n\r\n9. <strong>Eyeshadow and Eyeliner</strong>\r\n\r\nEye shadow is used to highlight or draw attention to the eyes, or to make them look attractive. It is applied on the upper eyelids, and sometimes even on the lower eyelids, and under the eyebrows. Different colors and different types of eye shadow provide difference look and feel. There are matte, liquid and shimmer and several other types. Shimmer is used for sexy look usually in parties, while matte is used for plain looks for more professional settings. Find out how to choose the right type of eyeshadow and how to apply them here. &lt;LINK&gt;\r\n\r\nEyeliner is used to emphasize or change the shape of the eye. The difference between eye shadow and eyeliner is that eye shadow is used recreate and design the frame of the eye as well as to throw in some colors, whereas the eyeliner is used only to change the shape of the eye. Eyeliner is applied close to contours or rim of the eye, while the eye shadow is applied in more outer areas as well. You can use either an eyeshadow or eyeliner, or even a combination of both during your makeup depending on your preferences. Usually lighter eyeliners provide better and more open looks to the eyes. I have compiled another article to go deeper in this. &lt;LINK&gt;\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on eye shadows and eyeliners, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of eye shadows and liners soon.

Most mascaras come with an applicator, but since there are so many different types of applicators available for applying mascara on eyelashes, you can get a specific type according to your preference. Here is a detailed article on how to pick the right mascara and an applicator, and how to apply it on eyelashes. &lt;LINK&gt;\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on mascaras, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of mascaras soon.

It is used to enhance the shape of eyebrow, to thicken it, or to lengthen it, or broaden it up. Some people even remove or wax the entire eyebrows before drawing completely new ones from with the brow pencil, may be because they don’t like their eyebrows or may be they just want to try something new. Brow pencil comes in various types and colors. A pencil may have a thick end or a pointy end. Pointy-ended pencil is used to define details and outlines, while thick-ended pencil is used for applying makeup in large, base areas. In addition to the pencil, usually a brow pencil kit also contains tweezers to remove any stray hair, as well as a brow brush or comb to arrange the hair strands.\r\n\r\nHere is more detailed article on how to choose and use a brow pencil kit. &lt;LINK&gt;\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on brow pencils, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of eye creams soon.

Some lipsticks provide protection to lips as well in a similar way as lip balms.\r\n\r\nLip gloss is used to provide a lustrous or shiny finish and sometime a subtle color to the lips. They can have various types of metallic, glittery, frosted or glossy finishes.\r\n\r\nLipstick is usually applied for parties as well as formal settings, while lip gloss generally for parties, weekends and late nights. There are many more points about lipsticks and lip gloss that need to be covered which you can find here. &lt;LINK&gt;\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on eye creams, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of eye creams soon.

Once again, there are a variety of perfumes for different occasions that you can get. Not all perfumes go well on every personality and you have to experiment with several of them to see which one suits your personality.

However, when choosing the beauty or make up products you should keep in mind the long term effects its going to cause on your skin. You should use the skin care products along with make-up products as a precautionary measure to reduce the chances of spoiling your skin. Also, while shopping at a store, some girls find it hard to pick products at the cosmetics section. In this article, I have created a list of beauty supply that a girl should have to complete her makeup and skin care kit.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I will be writing articles progressively and posting them on this website to provide ladies with tips, tricks and guidance on how to properly use their makeup kits and use different cosmetics for different purposes like a pro. I will be comparing different products from all types of cosmetics from our beauty supply list so that the girls can make better choice on which product and brand to use or try.\r\n\r\nI will also be making efforts to find and recommend the right places, stores, companies or people to get the cheapest but good quality products for the users of this website so that they can afford to look attractive.\r\n\r\nYou can follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, etc.\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Cleanser</strong>\r\nA cleanser is used to wash away make-up, dirt, pollutants, oil and other impurities from the surface of the skin. Its a better alternative to bar soap and other skin cleansers because of various reasons such as, (i) skin pH is about 4.7 where as soap has a high pH between 9-10, which can imbalance the skin pH thus causing further growth of bacteria increasing acne, (ii) bar soap contains thickeners which clog up skin pores causing acne, and (iii) bar soap on the face removes natural oil which in turn causes sebaceous glands to overproduce oils causing acne. For these reasons, a facial cleanser is recommended instead of a soap to wash the face with. Usually, a cleanser is used as a part of skin care regimen in combination with a toner and a moisturizer.\r\n\r\nA cleanser is of utmost importance for the longevity of a healthy, acne-and-wrinkle-free skin along with some other anti-aging products especially if you put on heavy make-up very frequently.\r\n\r\nCleanser should be used twice a day, before and after sleep, because the skin gets affected from pollutants every day even within few hours and most cleansers are not harsh on skin.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on cleansers, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of cleansers soon.\r\n\r\n2. <strong>Exfoliator</strong>\r\nAn exfoliator is basically like a soap or cream or lotion with granular particles in it which is applied or rubbed on the face and then washed off. It is used to remove dead and coarse skin cells from the face to make the skin smooth and soft.\r\n\r\nGentle or light exfoliator should be used once a day. However, since most exfoliators are not gentle, they should not be used more than once or twice a week.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on exfoliators, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of exfoliators soon.\r\n\r\n3. <strong>Serum</strong>\r\n\r\nSerums are like moisturizers that provide active ingredients, antioxidants, hydrators and anti-inflammatories to the skin to keep it healthy and reduce its aging, wrinkles, and fine lines. Serums are quite concentrated and you have to be careful in using them, which I will cover in future articles. Serums are not necessary for a skin care regimen. However, if your skin has less problems, you have to wear less make-up to cover it up. Serums make your skin look healthier, radiant, younger and fresher. However, if you are suffering from Rosacea or eczema, you should avoid using a serum as it may cause aggravation.\r\n\r\nSerums should be used twice a day on regular basis. In the morning, the layer of sunscreen should be applied over the layer of serum, while at night a layer of moisturizer should be applied over the layer of serum.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on serums, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of serums soon.\r\n\r\n4.<strong> Moisturizer</strong>\r\nMoisturizer is basically used to make the outer skin softer, smoother and more elastic, and to remove dryness through reducing evaporation. It contains natural or artificial oils, natural skin lipids and sterols, plant extracts, lubricants etc.\r\n\r\nMoisturizer should be used once or twice a day. But avoid using too much moisturizer at once as it could be more damaging than being healthy. Also, its important for you to know what type of ingredients your skin needs in a perfect moisturizer amongst the thousands that are available. Changing the type of moisturizer as your skin changes during various seasons of the year is also important. I have created another article to cover all such issues. I will be covering more details on moisturizers, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of moisturizers soon.\r\n\r\nSome of my favorite moisturizers are (i) Cetaphil Daily Moisturizer, which works well for me as well as many of my friends with normal or even excessively dry or super oily skin, and (ii) Aveeno Natural Radiance, which is not as good but has thinner constituency and so its absorbed into the skin quickly, and it does make the skin look radiant indeed.\r\n\r\n5. <strong>Eye Cream</strong>\r\nSome people tend to not give special importance or any kind of priority to the skin surrounding the eyes. They feel that the other facial products will also take care of the eye skin. Besides, the eye creams are usually more expensive than other facial products. However, whether or not the eye cream fits in your budget, whether or not eye creams seem important to you, you should know a few things about why they exist at all.\r\n\r\nThe skin surrounding the eyes is more sensitive and fragile as compared to other areas, and its needs are totally different which regular facial products cannot fulfill. The skin around the eyes tends to age quicker, and is more prone to dryness and fatigue, thus forming dark circles easily. The eye cream is specifically designed to handle such issues by providing the area with proper elements that it needs most. I will be covering on eye creams in future articles.\r\n\r\nWhether or not you want to focus on eye cream is upto you. However, if you do get one, you should use it once or twice a day. If you use once a day, use it at night.\r\n\r\n6. <strong>Foundation Or Tinted Moisturizer</strong>\r\nSo far we were only discussing about the products for our skin care regimen. Foundation is the first actual product from our beauty supply kit (or our makeup kit :P). Foundation is a skin-tinting pigment used to cover skin flaws and create a uniform complexion, or to change the color-tone of natural complexion. Foundation can be liquid or powder. Liquid foundation can be dewy or matte, while powder foundation can be illuminating or matte. If you suffer from dry skin or rosacea, try avoiding the powder and go for liquid, because powder will affect your skin negatively in long run. If you have oily skin, try to avoid dewy finish using a mix of liquid and powder foundations. I will be covering in future articles more on how to select and apply foundation.\r\n\r\nSome people have a misconception that tint-moisturizer is another skin care cream similar to other regular moisturizers or serums. However, when you match the ingredients of a foundation to those of a tint-moisturizer, you will notice striking similarities, such as use of solvent, mixtures of humectants and emollients, surfactants to keep the emulsion-type products mixed in a creamy base, ingredients to control the pH and thickness, skin toning pigments such as iron-oxide, titanium dioxide and mica, as well as preservatives to keep the product sanitized.\r\n\r\nSo a tint-moisturizer is basically a foundation. However, its a mild form of foundation since the amount of pigments used are usually less as compared to a foundation. Also, a tint-moisturizer hydrates skin better than a foundation due to higher concentration of humectants. Some brands’ foundation may act the same way as another brands’ tint-moisturizer though. So the two types of products vary a lot from brand to brand. You will have to figure out which type and brand works well for you depending on your preferences, skin type and season. But you definitely don’t need both products.\r\n\r\nIt should be obvious by now that tinted moisturizer shouldn’t be treated as a part of skin care regimen. Stay tuned for more about foundations and tinted moisturizers.\r\n\r\n7. <strong>Concealer</strong>\r\nWhile foundation is used to even out the skin tone across your face, concealer is used to hide zits, dark circles or scars. In some cases, foundation is able to hide what you are trying to hide, but if it doesn’t, use a concealer. Concealer usually goes on top of foundation, if both concealer and foundation are used. However, if you are not wearing any make up and just need to hide the marks, you can use just concealer without any layer of foundation.\r\n\r\nGo here for tips on how to use concealer like a professional. &lt;LINK&gt;\r\n\r\nI will be covering detailed tips in future articles on how to use concealers like a professional.\r\n\r\n8. <strong>Blush and Bronzer</strong>\r\nBlush, also called rouge, is used to redden the cheeks. Bronzer gives a suntan appearance to the skin, and contours and highlights the cheekbone. Sometimes, the application of blush and bronzer can amazingly change the features of the face.\r\n\r\nBronzer is usually applied before blush. There are several different types of blushes and bronzers. I will be writing more articles on how to pick the right one for your skin and how to apply them.\r\n\r\n9. <strong>Eyeshadow and Eyeliner</strong>\r\n\r\nEye shadow is used to highlight or draw attention to the eyes, or to make them look attractive. It is applied on the upper eyelids, and sometimes even on the lower eyelids, and under the eyebrows. Different colors and different types of eye shadow provide difference look and feel. There are matte, liquid and shimmer and several other types. Shimmer is used for sexy look usually in parties, while matte is used for plain looks for more professional settings. I will be adding more information in future articles on how to choose the right type of eyeshadow and how to apply them here.\r\n\r\nEyeliner is used to emphasize or change the shape of the eye. The difference between eye shadow and eyeliner is that eye shadow is used recreate and design the frame of the eye as well as to throw in some colors, whereas the eyeliner is used only to change the shape of the eye. Eyeliner is applied close to contours or rim of the eye, while the eye shadow is applied in more outer areas as well. You can use either an eyeshadow or eyeliner, or even a combination of both during your makeup depending on your preferences. Usually lighter eyeliners provide better and more open looks to the eyes. I will be compiling another article to go deeper in this.\r\n\r\n10. <strong>Mascara</strong>\r\nMascara is used for thickening, coloring, enhancing, curling or even lengthening the eyelashes. It comes in various forms primarily liquid, cream and cake (or powder). It is important to choose the right type of mascara for the right occasion and duration. Most mascaras come with an applicator, but since there are so many different types of applicators available for applying mascara on eyelashes, you can get a specific type according to your preference. I will be adding a detailed article on how to pick the right mascara and an applicator, and how to apply it on eyelashes.\r\n\r\n11. <strong>Brow Pencil</strong>\r\nA brow pencil is like a regular pencil with makeup instead of lead. It is used to enhance the shape of eyebrow, to thicken it, or to lengthen it, or broaden it up. Some people even remove or wax the entire eyebrows before drawing completely new ones from with the brow pencil, may be because they don’t like their eyebrows or may be they just want to try something new. Brow pencil comes in various types and colors. A pencil may have a thick end or a pointy end. Pointy-ended pencil is used to define details and outlines, while thick-ended pencil is used for applying makeup in large, base areas. In addition to the pencil, usually a brow pencil kit also contains tweezers to remove any stray hair, as well as a brow brush or comb to arrange the hair strands.\r\n\r\nI will be adding a more detailed article soon on how to choose and use a brow pencil kit.\r\n\r\n12. <strong>Lipstick and Lip Gloss</strong>\r\nLipstick is like a wax applied on lips to change their color and texture to make the face look more attractive.

Stay tuned.\r\n\r\n13. <strong>Nail Polish</strong>\r\n\r\nNail polish or paint is used to color the nails. Most of the time the terms nail polish and nail paint are used interchangeably, but some people prefer to call nail paint for the matte color while a nail polish for the lustrous or shiny color. This difference in terms is usually created by the brands and manufacturers. A nail paint gives an attractive look to the nails and is an important mark of makeup. Many women these days make creative designs on their nails using nail paints of different color instead of simply painting all the nails with one color. Since nail paints cannot be removed by simply by washing them, a special product called nail paint remover comes separate to assist with this task.\r\n\r\nI will be covering nails in more detail soon.\r\n\r\n14. <strong>Perfume</strong>\r\nPerfume is the last but most important part of this beauty supply article to complete our makeup kit. Perfume is a spray used to give a pleasant smell to the body. A make up seems to be incomplete without a good perfume. Once again, there are a variety of perfumes for different occasions that you can get. Not all perfumes go well on every personality and you have to experiment with several of them to see which one suits your personality. There are many tips and advises about perfumes that I will be covering in future articles.', 'Beauty Supply That A Girl Should Have In Stock', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '4-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-03-09 00:29:03', '2016-03-09 00:29:03', '', 4, 'http://localhost:8080/femina/index.php/2016/03/09/4-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(15, 1, '2016-03-09 00:30:49', '2016-03-09 00:30:49', 'Looking pretty and attractive at a party is essential for every girl. For that, she needs to have a perfect make-up kit among other priorities. However, when choosing the beauty or make up products you should keep in mind the long term effects its going to cause on your skin. You should use the skin care products along with make-up products as a precautionary measure to reduce the chances of spoiling your skin. Also, while shopping at a store, some girls find it hard to pick products at the cosmetics section. In this article, I have created a list of beauty supply that a girl should have to complete her makeup and skin care kit.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I will be writing articles progressively and posting them on this website to provide ladies with tips, tricks and guidance on how to properly use their makeup kits and use different cosmetics for different purposes like a pro. I will be comparing different products from all types of cosmetics from our beauty supply list so that the girls can make better choice on which product and brand to use or try.\r\n\r\nI will also be making efforts to find and recommend the right places, stores, companies or people to get the cheapest but good quality products for the users of this website so that they can afford to look attractive.\r\n\r\nYou can follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, etc.\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Cleanser</strong>\r\nA &lt;BEAUTY SUPPLY&gt; cleanser is used to wash away make-up, dirt, pollutants, oil and other impurities from the surface of the skin. Its a better alternative to bar soap and other skin cleansers because of various reasons such as, (i) skin pH is about 4.7 where as soap has a high pH between 9-10, which can imbalance the skin pH thus causing further growth of bacteria increasing acne, (ii) bar soap contains thickeners which clog up skin pores causing acne, and (iii) bar soap on the face removes natural oil which in turn causes sebaceous glands to overproduce oils causing acne. For &lt;BEAUTY SUPPLY&gt;these reasons, a facial cleanser is recommended instead of a soap to wash the face with. Usually, a cleanser is used as a part of skin care regimen in combination with a toner and a moisturizer.\r\n\r\nA cleanser is of utmost importance for the longevity of a healthy, acne-and-wrinkle-free &lt;BEAUTY SUPPLY&gt;skin along with some other anti-aging products especially if you put on heavy make-up very frequently.\r\n\r\nCleanser should be used twice a day, before and after sleep, because the skin gets affected from pollutants every day even within few hours and most cleansers are not harsh on skin.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more &lt;BEAUTY SUPPLY&gt;details on cleansers, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of cleansers soon.\r\n\r\n2. <strong>Exfoliator</strong>\r\nAn exfoliator is basically &lt;BEAUTY SUPPLY&gt;like a soap or cream or lotion with granular particles in it which is applied or rubbed on the face and then washed off. It is used to remove dead and &lt;BEAUTY SUPPLY&gt;coarse skin cells from the face to make the skin smooth and soft.\r\n\r\nGentle or light exfoliator should be used once a day. However, since most exfoliators are not gentle, they should not be used more than once or twice a week.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on exfoliators, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of exfoliators soon.\r\n\r\n3. <strong>Serum</strong>\r\n\r\nSerums are like moisturizers that provide active ingredients, antioxidants, hydrators and anti-inflammatories to the skin to keep it healthy and reduce its aging, wrinkles, and fine lines. Serums are quite concentrated and you have to be careful in using them, which I will cover in future articles. Serums are not necessary for a skin care regimen. However, if your skin has less problems, you have to wear less make-up to cover it up. Serums make your skin look healthier, radiant, younger and fresher. However, if you are suffering from Rosacea or eczema, you should avoid using a serum as it may cause aggravation.\r\n\r\nSerums should be used twice a day on regular basis. In the morning, the layer of sunscreen should be applied over the layer of serum, while at night a layer of moisturizer should be applied over the layer of serum.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on serums, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of serums soon.\r\n\r\n4.<strong> Moisturizer</strong>\r\nMoisturizer is basically used to make the outer skin softer, smoother and more elastic, and to remove dryness through reducing evaporation. It contains natural or artificial oils, natural skin lipids and sterols, plant extracts, lubricants etc.\r\n\r\nMoisturizer should be used once or twice a day. But avoid using too much moisturizer at once as it could be more damaging than being healthy. Also, its important for you to know what type of ingredients your skin needs in a perfect moisturizer amongst the thousands that are available. Changing the type of moisturizer as your skin changes during various seasons of the year is also important. I have created another article to cover all such issues. I will be covering more details on moisturizers, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of moisturizers soon.\r\n\r\nSome of my favorite moisturizers are (i) Cetaphil Daily Moisturizer, which works well for me as well as many of my friends with normal or even excessively dry or super oily skin, and (ii) Aveeno Natural Radiance, which is not as good but has thinner constituency and so its absorbed into the skin quickly, and it does make the skin look radiant indeed.\r\n\r\n5. <strong>Eye Cream</strong>\r\nSome people tend to not give special importance or any kind of priority to the skin surrounding the eyes. They feel that the other facial products will also take care of the eye skin. Besides, the eye creams are usually more expensive than other facial products. However, whether or not the eye cream fits in your budget, whether or not eye creams seem important to you, you should know a few things about why they exist at all.\r\n\r\nThe skin surrounding the eyes is more sensitive and fragile as compared to other areas, and its needs are totally different which regular facial products cannot fulfill. The skin around the eyes tends to age quicker, and is more prone to dryness and fatigue, thus forming dark circles easily. The eye cream is specifically designed to handle such issues by providing the area with proper elements that it needs most. I will be covering on eye creams in future articles.\r\n\r\nWhether or not you want to focus on eye cream is upto you. However, if you do get one, you should use it once or twice a day. If you use once a day, use it at night.\r\n\r\n6. <strong>Foundation Or Tinted Moisturizer</strong>\r\nSo far we were only discussing about the products for our skin care regimen. Foundation is the first actual product from our beauty supply kit (or our makeup kit :P). Foundation is a skin-tinting pigment used to cover skin flaws and create a uniform complexion, or to change the color-tone of natural complexion. Foundation can be liquid or powder. Liquid foundation can be dewy or matte, while powder foundation can be illuminating or matte. If you suffer from dry skin or rosacea, try avoiding the powder and go for liquid, because powder will affect your skin negatively in long run. If you have oily skin, try to avoid dewy finish using a mix of liquid and powder foundations. I will be covering in future articles more on how to select and apply foundation.\r\n\r\nSome people have a misconception that tint-moisturizer is another skin care cream similar to other regular moisturizers or serums. However, when you match the ingredients of a foundation to those of a tint-moisturizer, you will notice striking similarities, such as use of solvent, mixtures of humectants and emollients, surfactants to keep the emulsion-type products mixed in a creamy base, ingredients to control the pH and thickness, skin toning pigments such as iron-oxide, titanium dioxide and mica, as well as preservatives to keep the product sanitized.\r\n\r\nSo a tint-moisturizer is basically a foundation. However, its a mild form of foundation since the amount of pigments used are usually less as compared to a foundation. Also, a tint-moisturizer hydrates skin better than a foundation due to higher concentration of humectants. Some brands’ foundation may act the same way as another brands’ tint-moisturizer though. So the two types of products vary a lot from brand to brand. You will have to figure out which type and brand works well for you depending on your preferences, skin type and season. But you definitely don’t need both products.\r\n\r\nIt should be obvious by now that tinted moisturizer shouldn’t be treated as a part of skin care regimen. Stay tuned for more about foundations and tinted moisturizers.\r\n\r\n7. <strong>Concealer</strong>\r\nWhile foundation is used to even out the skin tone across your face, concealer is used to hide zits, dark circles or scars. In some cases, foundation is able to hide what you are trying to hide, but if it doesn’t, use a concealer. Concealer usually goes on top of foundation, if both concealer and foundation are used. However, if you are not wearing any make up and just need to hide the marks, you can use just concealer without any layer of foundation.\r\n\r\nI will be covering detailed tips in future articles on how to use concealers like a professional.\r\n\r\n8. <strong>Blush and Bronzer</strong>\r\nBlush, also called rouge, is used to redden the cheeks. Bronzer gives a suntan appearance to the skin, and contours and highlights the cheekbone. Sometimes, the application of blush and bronzer can amazingly change the features of the face.\r\n\r\nBronzer is usually applied before blush. There are several different types of blushes and bronzers. I will be writing more articles on how to pick the right one for your skin and how to apply them.\r\n\r\n9. <strong>Eyeshadow and Eyeliner</strong>\r\n\r\nEye shadow is used to highlight or draw attention to the eyes, or to make them look attractive. It is applied on the upper eyelids, and sometimes even on the lower eyelids, and under the eyebrows. Different colors and different types of eye shadow provide difference look and feel. There are matte, liquid and shimmer and several other types. Shimmer is used for sexy look usually in parties, while matte is used for plain looks for more professional settings. I will be adding more information in future articles on how to choose the right type of eyeshadow and how to apply them here.\r\n\r\nEyeliner is used to emphasize or change the shape of the eye. The difference between eye shadow and eyeliner is that eye shadow is used recreate and design the frame of the eye as well as to throw in some colors, whereas the eyeliner is used only to change the shape of the eye. Eyeliner is applied close to contours or rim of the eye, while the eye shadow is applied in more outer areas as well. You can use either an eyeshadow or eyeliner, or even a combination of both during your makeup depending on your preferences. Usually lighter eyeliners provide better and more open looks to the eyes. I will be compiling another article to go deeper in this.\r\n\r\n10. <strong>Mascara</strong>\r\nMascara is used for thickening, coloring, enhancing, curling or even lengthening the eyelashes. It comes in various forms primarily liquid, cream and cake (or powder). It is important to choose the right type of mascara for the right occasion and duration. Most mascaras come with an applicator, but since there are so many different types of applicators available for applying mascara on eyelashes, you can get a specific type according to your preference. I will be adding a detailed article on how to pick the right mascara and an applicator, and how to apply it on eyelashes.\r\n\r\n11. <strong>Brow Pencil</strong>\r\nA brow pencil is like a regular pencil with makeup instead of lead. It is used to enhance the shape of eyebrow, to thicken it, or to lengthen it, or broaden it up. Some people even &lt;BEAUTY SUPPLY&gt; remove or wax the entire eyebrows before drawing completely new ones from with the brow pencil, may be because they don’t like their eyebrows or may be they just want to try something new. Brow pencil comes in various types and colors. A pencil may have a &lt;BEAUTY SUPPLY&gt; thick end or a pointy end. Pointy-ended pencil is used to define details and outlines, while thick-ended pencil is used for applying makeup in large, base areas. In addition to the pencil, usually a brow pencil kit also contains tweezers to remove any stray hair, as well as a brow brush or comb to arrange the hair strands.\r\n\r\nI will be adding a more detailed article soon on how to choose and use a brow pencil kit.\r\n\r\n12. <strong>Lipstick and Lip Gloss</strong>\r\nLipstick is like a wax applied on lips to change their color and texture to make the face look more attractive. Some lipsticks provide protection to lips as well in a similar way as lip balms.\r\n\r\nLip gloss is used to provide a lustrous or shiny finish and sometime a subtle color to the lips. They can have various types of metallic, glittery, frosted or glossy finishes.\r\n\r\nLipstick is usually applied for parties as well as formal settings, while lip gloss generally for parties, weekends and late nights. There are many more points about lipsticks and lip gloss that need to be covered. Stay tuned.\r\n\r\n13. <strong>Nail Polish</strong>\r\n\r\nNail polish or paint is used to color the nails. Most of the time the terms nail polish and nail paint are used interchangeably, but some people prefer to call nail paint for the matte color while a nail polish for the lustrous or shiny color. This difference in terms is usually created by the brands and manufacturers. A nail paint gives an attractive look to the nails and is an important mark of makeup. Many women these days make creative designs on their nails using nail paints of different color instead of simply painting all the nails with one color. Since nail paints cannot be removed by simply by washing them, a special product called nail paint remover comes separate to assist with this task.\r\n\r\nI will be covering nails in more detail soon.\r\n\r\n14. <strong>Perfume</strong>\r\nPerfume is the last but most important part of this beauty supply article to complete our makeup kit.

(17, 1, '2016-03-09 00:37:15', '2016-03-09 00:37:15', 'Looking pretty and attractive at a party is essential for every girl. For that, she needs to have a perfect make-up kit among other priorities. However, when choosing the beauty or make up products you should keep in mind the long term effects its going to cause on your skin. You should use the skin care products along with make-up products as a precautionary measure to reduce the chances of spoiling your skin. Also, while shopping at a store, some girls find it hard to pick products at the cosmetics section. In this article, I have created a list of beauty supply that a girl should have to complete her makeup and skin care kit.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I will be writing articles progressively and posting them on this website to provide ladies with tips, tricks and guidance on how to properly use their makeup kits and use different cosmetics for different purposes like a pro. I will be comparing different products from all types of cosmetics from our beauty supply list so that the girls can make better choice on which product and brand to use or try.\r\n\r\nI will also be making efforts to find and recommend the right places, stores, companies or people to get the cheapest but good quality products for the users of this website so that they can afford to look attractive.\r\n\r\nYou can follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, etc.\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Cleanser</strong>\r\nA cleanser is used to wash away make-up, dirt, pollutants, oil and other impurities from the surface of the skin. Its a better alternative to bar soap and other skin cleansers because of various reasons such as, (i) skin pH is about 4.7 where as soap has a high pH between 9-10, which can imbalance the skin pH thus causing further growth of bacteria increasing acne, (ii) bar soap contains thickeners which clog up skin pores causing acne, and (iii) bar soap on the face removes natural oil which in turn causes sebaceous glands to overproduce oils causing acne. For these reasons, a facial cleanser is recommended instead of a soap to wash the face with. Usually, a cleanser is used as a part of skin care regimen in combination with a toner and a moisturizer.\r\n\r\nA cleanser is of utmost importance for the longevity of a healthy, acne-and-wrinkle-free skin along with some other anti-aging products especially if you put on heavy make-up very frequently.\r\n\r\nCleanser should be used twice a day, before and after sleep, because the skin gets affected from pollutants every day even within few hours and most cleansers are not harsh on skin.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on cleansers, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of cleansers soon for the beauty supply list.\r\n\r\n2. <strong>Exfoliator</strong>\r\nAn exfoliator is basically like a soap or cream or lotion with granular particles in it which is applied or rubbed on the face and then washed off. It is used to remove dead and coarse skin cells from the face to make the skin smooth and soft.\r\n\r\nGentle or light exfoliator should be used once a day. However, since most exfoliators are not gentle, they should not be used more than once or twice a week.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on exfoliators, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of exfoliators soon for the beauty supply list.\r\n\r\n3. <strong>Serum</strong>\r\n\r\nSerums are like moisturizers that provide active ingredients, antioxidants, hydrators and anti-inflammatories to the skin to keep it healthy and reduce its aging, wrinkles, and fine lines. Serums are quite concentrated and you have to be careful in using them, which I will cover in future articles. Serums are not necessary for a skin care regimen. However, if your skin has less problems, you have to wear less make-up to cover it up. Serums make your skin look healthier, radiant, younger and fresher. However, if you are suffering from Rosacea or eczema, you should avoid using a serum as it may cause aggravation.\r\n\r\nSerums should be used twice a day on regular basis. In the morning, the layer of sunscreen should be applied over the layer of serum, while at night a layer of moisturizer should be applied over the layer of serum.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on serums, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of serums soon for the beauty supply list.\r\n\r\n4.<strong> Moisturizer</strong>\r\nMoisturizer is basically used to make the outer skin softer, smoother and more elastic, and to remove dryness through reducing evaporation. It contains natural or artificial oils, natural skin lipids and sterols, plant extracts, lubricants etc.\r\n\r\nMoisturizer should be used once or twice a day. But avoid using too much moisturizer at once as it could be more damaging than being healthy. Also, its important for you to know what type of ingredients your skin needs in a perfect moisturizer amongst the thousands that are available. Changing the type of moisturizer as your skin changes during various seasons of the year is also important. I have created another article to cover all such issues. I will be covering more details on moisturizers, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of moisturizers soon.\r\n\r\nSome of my favorite moisturizers are (i) Cetaphil Daily Moisturizer, which works well for me as well as many of my friends with normal or even excessively dry or super oily skin, and (ii) Aveeno Natural Radiance, which is not as good but has thinner constituency and so its absorbed into the skin quickly, and it does make the skin look radiant indeed.\r\n\r\n5. <strong>Eye Cream</strong>\r\nSome people tend to not give special importance or any kind of priority to the skin surrounding the eyes. They feel that the other facial products will also take care of the eye skin. Besides, the eye creams are usually more expensive than other facial products. However, whether or not the eye cream fits in your budget, whether or not eye creams seem important to you, you should know a few things about why they exist at all.\r\n\r\nThe skin surrounding the eyes is more sensitive and fragile as compared to other areas, and its needs are totally different which regular facial products cannot fulfill. The skin around the eyes tends to age quicker, and is more prone to dryness and fatigue, thus forming dark circles easily. The eye cream is specifically designed to handle such issues by providing the area with proper elements that it needs most. I will be covering on eye creams in future articles.\r\n\r\nWhether or not you want to focus on eye cream is upto you. However, if you do get one, you should use it once or twice a day. If you use once a day, use it at night.\r\n\r\n6. <strong>Foundation Or Tinted Moisturizer</strong>\r\nSo far we were only discussing about the products for our skin care regimen. Foundation is the first actual product from our beauty supply kit (or our makeup kit :P). Foundation is a skin-tinting pigment used to cover skin flaws and create a uniform complexion, or to change the color-tone of natural complexion. Foundation can be liquid or powder. Liquid foundation can be dewy or matte, while powder foundation can be illuminating or matte. If you suffer from dry skin or rosacea, try avoiding the powder and go for liquid, because powder will affect your skin negatively in long run. If you have oily skin, try to avoid dewy finish using a mix of liquid and powder foundations. I will be covering in future articles more on how to select and apply foundation.\r\n\r\nSome people have a misconception that tint-moisturizer is another skin care cream similar to other regular moisturizers or serums. However, when you match the ingredients of a foundation to those of a tint-moisturizer, you will notice striking similarities, such as use of solvent, mixtures of humectants and emollients, surfactants to keep the emulsion-type products mixed in a creamy base, ingredients to control the pH and thickness, skin toning pigments such as iron-oxide, titanium dioxide and mica, as well as preservatives to keep the product sanitized.\r\n\r\nSo a tint-moisturizer is basically a foundation. However, its a mild form of foundation since the amount of pigments used are usually less as compared to a foundation. Also, a tint-moisturizer hydrates skin better than a foundation due to higher concentration of humectants. Some brands’ foundation may act the same way as another brands’ tint-moisturizer though. So the two types of products vary a lot from brand to brand. You will have to figure out which type and brand works well for you depending on your preferences, skin type and season. But you definitely don’t need both products.\r\n\r\nIt should be obvious by now that tinted moisturizer shouldn’t be treated as a part of skin care regimen. Stay tuned for more about foundations and tinted moisturizers.\r\n\r\n7. <strong>Concealer</strong>\r\nWhile foundation is used to even out the skin tone across your face, concealer is used to hide zits, dark circles or scars. In some cases, foundation is able to hide what you are trying to hide, but if it doesn’t, use a concealer. Concealer usually goes on top of foundation, if both concealer and foundation are used. However, if you are not wearing any make up and just need to hide the marks, you can use just concealer without any layer of foundation.\r\n\r\nI will be covering detailed tips in future articles on how to use concealers like a professional.\r\n\r\n8. <strong>Blush and Bronzer</strong>\r\nBlush, also called rouge, is used to redden the cheeks. Bronzer gives a suntan appearance to the skin, and contours and highlights the cheekbone. Sometimes, the application of blush and bronzer can amazingly change the features of the face.\r\n\r\nBronzer is usually applied before blush. There are several different types of blushes and bronzers. I will be writing more articles on how to pick the right one for your skin and how to apply them.\r\n\r\n9. <strong>Eyeshadow and Eyeliner</strong>\r\n\r\nEye shadow is used to highlight or draw attention to the eyes, or to make them look attractive. It is applied on the upper eyelids, and sometimes even on the lower eyelids, and under the eyebrows. Different colors and different types of eye shadow provide difference look and feel. There are matte, liquid and shimmer and several other types. Shimmer is used for sexy look usually in parties, while matte is used for plain looks for more professional settings. I will be adding more information in future articles on how to choose the right type of eyeshadow and how to apply them here.\r\n\r\nEyeliner is used to emphasize or change the shape of the eye. The difference between eye shadow and eyeliner is that eye shadow is used recreate and design the frame of the eye as well as to throw in some colors, whereas the eyeliner is used only to change the shape of the eye. Eyeliner is applied close to contours or rim of the eye, while the eye shadow is applied in more outer areas as well. You can use either an eyeshadow or eyeliner, or even a combination of both during your makeup depending on your preferences. Usually lighter eyeliners provide better and more open looks to the eyes. I will be compiling another article to go deeper in this.\r\n\r\n10. <strong>Mascara</strong>\r\nMascara is used for thickening, coloring, enhancing, curling or even lengthening the eyelashes. It comes in various forms primarily liquid, cream and cake (or powder). It is important to choose the right type of mascara for the right occasion and duration. Most mascaras come with an applicator, but since there are so many different types of applicators available for applying mascara on eyelashes, you can get a specific type according to your preference. I will be adding a detailed article on how to pick the right mascara and an applicator, and how to apply it on eyelashes.\r\n\r\n11. <strong>Brow Pencil</strong>\r\nA brow pencil is like a regular pencil with makeup instead of lead. It is used to enhance the shape of eyebrow, to thicken it, or to lengthen it, or broaden it up. Some people even remove or wax the entire eyebrows before drawing completely new ones from with the brow pencil, may be because they don’t like their eyebrows or may be they just want to try something new. Brow pencil comes in various types and colors. A pencil may have a thick end or a pointy end. Pointy-ended pencil is used to define details and outlines, while thick-ended pencil is used for applying makeup in large, base areas. In addition to the pencil, usually a brow pencil kit also contains tweezers to remove any stray hair, as well as a brow brush or comb to arrange the hair strands.\r\n\r\nI will be adding a more detailed article soon on how to choose and use a brow pencil kit.\r\n\r\n12. <strong>Lipstick and Lip Gloss</strong>\r\nLipstick is like a wax applied on lips to change their color and texture to make the face look more attractive. Some lipsticks provide protection to lips as well in a similar way as lip balms.\r\n\r\nLip gloss is used to provide a lustrous or shiny finish and sometime a subtle color to the lips. They can have various types of metallic, glittery, frosted or glossy finishes.\r\n\r\nLipstick is usually applied for parties as well as formal settings, while lip gloss generally for parties, weekends and late nights. There are many more points about lipsticks and lip gloss that need to be covered. Stay tuned.\r\n\r\n13. <strong>Nail Polish</strong>\r\n\r\nNail polish or paint is used to color the nails. Most of the time the terms nail polish and nail paint are used interchangeably, but some people prefer to call nail paint for the matte color while a nail polish for the lustrous or shiny color. This difference in terms is usually created by the brands and manufacturers. A nail paint gives an attractive look to the nails and is an important mark of makeup. Many women these days make creative designs on their nails using nail paints of different color instead of simply painting all the nails with one color. Since nail paints cannot be removed by simply by washing them, a special product called nail paint remover comes separate to assist with this task.\r\n\r\nI will be covering nails in more detail soon.\r\n\r\n14. <strong>Perfume</strong>\r\nPerfume is the last but most important part of this beauty supply article to complete our makeup kit. Perfume is a spray used to give a pleasant smell to the body. A make up seems to be incomplete without a good perfume. Once again, there are a variety of perfumes for different occasions that you can get.

I will be comparing different products from all types of cosmetics from our beauty supply list so that the girls can make better choice on which product and brand to use or try.\r\n\r\nI will also be making efforts to find and recommend the right places, stores, companies or people to get the cheapest but good quality products for the users of this website so that they can afford to look attractive.\r\n\r\nYou can follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, etc.\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Cleanser</strong>\r\nA cleanser is used to wash away make-up, dirt, pollutants, oil and other impurities from the surface of the skin. Its a better alternative to bar soap and other skin cleansers because of various reasons such as, (i) skin pH is about 4.7 where as soap has a high pH between 9-10, which can imbalance the skin pH thus causing further growth of bacteria increasing acne, (ii) bar soap contains thickeners which clog up skin pores causing acne, and (iii) bar soap on the face removes natural oil which in turn causes sebaceous glands to overproduce oils causing acne. For these reasons, a facial cleanser is recommended instead of a soap to wash the face with. Usually, a cleanser is used as a part of skin care regimen in combination with a toner and a moisturizer.\r\n\r\nA cleanser is of utmost importance for the longevity of a healthy, acne-and-wrinkle-free skin along with some other anti-aging products especially if you put on heavy make-up very frequently.\r\n\r\nCleanser should be used twice a day, before and after sleep, because the skin gets affected from pollutants every day even within few hours and most cleansers are not harsh on skin.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on cleansers, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of cleansers soon for my beauty supply.\r\n\r\n2. <strong>Exfoliator</strong>\r\nAn exfoliator is basically like a soap or cream or lotion with granular particles in it which is applied or rubbed on the face and then washed off. It is used to remove dead and coarse skin cells from the face to make the skin smooth and soft.\r\n\r\nGentle or light exfoliator should be used once a day. However, since most exfoliators are not gentle, they should not be used more than once or twice a week.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on exfoliators, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of exfoliators soon for my beauty supply.\r\n\r\n3. <strong>Serum</strong>\r\n\r\nSerums are like moisturizers that provide active ingredients, antioxidants, hydrators and anti-inflammatories to the skin to keep it healthy and reduce its aging, wrinkles, and fine lines. Serums are quite concentrated and you have to be careful in using them, which I will cover in future articles. Serums are not necessary for a skin care regimen. However, if your skin has less problems, you have to wear less make-up to cover it up. Serums make your skin look healthier, radiant, younger and fresher. However, if you are suffering from Rosacea or eczema, you should avoid using a serum as it may cause aggravation.\r\n\r\nSerums should be used twice a day on regular basis. In the morning, the layer of sunscreen should be applied over the layer of serum, while at night a layer of moisturizer should be applied over the layer of serum.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on serums, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of serums soon for my beauty supply.\r\n\r\n4.<strong> Moisturizer</strong>\r\nMoisturizer is basically used to make the outer skin softer, smoother and more elastic, and to remove dryness through reducing evaporation. It contains natural or artificial oils, natural skin lipids and sterols, plant extracts, lubricants etc.\r\n\r\nMoisturizer should be used once or twice a day. But avoid using too much moisturizer at once as it could be more damaging than being healthy. Also, its important for you to know what type of ingredients your skin needs in a perfect moisturizer amongst the thousands that are available. Changing the type of moisturizer as your skin changes during various seasons of the year is also important. I have created another article to cover all such issues. I will be covering more details on moisturizers, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of moisturizers soon.\r\n\r\nSome of my favorite moisturizers are (i) Cetaphil Daily Moisturizer, which works well for me as well as many of my friends with normal or even excessively dry or super oily skin, and (ii) Aveeno Natural Radiance, which is not as good but has thinner constituency and so its absorbed into the skin quickly, and it does make the skin look radiant indeed.\r\n\r\n5. <strong>Eye Cream</strong>\r\nSome people tend to not give special importance or any kind of priority to the skin surrounding the eyes. They feel that the other facial products will also take care of the eye skin. Besides, the eye creams are usually more expensive than other facial products. However, whether or not the eye cream fits in your budget, whether or not eye creams seem important to you, you should know a few things about why they exist at all.\r\n\r\nThe skin surrounding the eyes is more sensitive and fragile as compared to other areas, and its needs are totally different which regular facial products cannot fulfill. The skin around the eyes tends to age quicker, and is more prone to dryness and fatigue, thus forming dark circles easily. The eye cream is specifically designed to handle such issues by providing the area with proper elements that it needs most. I will be covering on eye creams in future articles for my beauty supply.\r\n\r\nWhether or not you want to focus on eye cream is upto you. However, if you do get one, you should use it once or twice a day. If you use once a day, use it at night.\r\n\r\n6. <strong>Foundation Or Tinted Moisturizer</strong>\r\nSo far we were only discussing about the products for our skin care regimen. Foundation is the first actual product from our beauty supply kit (or our makeup kit :P). Foundation is a skin-tinting pigment used to cover skin flaws and create a uniform complexion, or to change the color-tone of natural complexion. Foundation can be liquid or powder. Liquid foundation can be dewy or matte, while powder foundation can be illuminating or matte. If you suffer from dry skin or rosacea, try avoiding the powder and go for liquid, because powder will affect your skin negatively in long run. If you have oily skin, try to avoid dewy finish using a mix of liquid and powder foundations. I will be covering in future articles more on how to select and apply foundation.\r\n\r\nSome people have a misconception that tint-moisturizer is another skin care cream similar to other regular moisturizers or serums. However, when you match the ingredients of a foundation to those of a tint-moisturizer, you will notice striking similarities, such as use of solvent, mixtures of humectants and emollients, surfactants to keep the emulsion-type products mixed in a creamy base, ingredients to control the pH and thickness, skin toning pigments such as iron-oxide, titanium dioxide and mica, as well as preservatives to keep the product sanitized.\r\n\r\nSo a tint-moisturizer is basically a foundation. However, its a mild form of foundation since the amount of pigments used are usually less as compared to a foundation. Also, a tint-moisturizer hydrates skin better than a foundation due to higher concentration of humectants. Some brands’ foundation may act the same way as another brands’ tint-moisturizer though. So the two types of products vary a lot from brand to brand. You will have to figure out which type and brand works well for you depending on your preferences, skin type and season. But you definitely don’t need both products.\r\n\r\nIt should be obvious by now that tinted moisturizer shouldn’t be treated as a part of skin care regimen. Stay tuned on my beauty supply for more about foundations and tinted moisturizers.\r\n\r\n7. <strong>Concealer</strong>\r\nWhile foundation is used to even out the skin tone across your face, concealer is used to hide zits, dark circles or scars. In some cases, foundation is able to hide what you are trying to hide, but if it doesn’t, use a concealer. Concealer usually goes on top of foundation, if both concealer and foundation are used. However, if you are not wearing any make up and just need to hide the marks, you can use just concealer without any layer of foundation.\r\n\r\nI will be covering detailed tips in future articles on how to use concealers like a professional.\r\n\r\n8. <strong>Blush and Bronzer</strong>\r\nBlush, also called rouge, is used to redden the cheeks. Bronzer gives a suntan appearance to the skin, and contours and highlights the cheekbone. Sometimes, the application of blush and bronzer can amazingly change the features of the face.\r\n\r\nBronzer is usually applied before blush. There are several different types of blushes and bronzers. I will be writing more articles for my beauty supply on how to pick the right one for your skin and how to apply them.\r\n\r\n9. <strong>Eyeshadow and Eyeliner</strong>\r\n\r\nEye shadow is used to highlight or draw attention to the eyes, or to make them look attractive. It is applied on the upper eyelids, and sometimes even on the lower eyelids, and under the eyebrows. Different colors and different types of eye shadow provide difference look and feel. There are matte, liquid and shimmer and several other types. Shimmer is used for sexy look usually in parties, while matte is used for plain looks for more professional settings. I will be adding more information in future articles on how to choose the right type of eyeshadow and how to apply them here.\r\n\r\nEyeliner is used to emphasize or change the shape of the eye. The difference between eye shadow and eyeliner is that eye shadow is used recreate and design the frame of the eye as well as to throw in some colors, whereas the eyeliner is used only to change the shape of the eye. Eyeliner is applied close to contours or rim of the eye, while the eye shadow is applied in more outer areas as well. You can use either an eyeshadow or eyeliner, or even a combination of both during your makeup depending on your preferences. Usually lighter eyeliners provide better and more open looks to the eyes. I will be compiling another article to go deeper in this.\r\n\r\n10. <strong>Mascara</strong>\r\nMascara is used for thickening, coloring, enhancing, curling or even lengthening the eyelashes. It comes in various forms primarily liquid, cream and cake (or powder). It is important to choose the right type of mascara for the right occasion and duration. Most mascaras come with an applicator, but since there are so many different types of applicators available for applying mascara on eyelashes, you can get a specific type according to your preference. I will be adding a detailed article on how to pick the right mascara and an applicator, and how to apply it on eyelashes.\r\n\r\n11. <strong>Brow Pencil</strong>\r\nA brow pencil is like a regular pencil with makeup instead of lead. It is used to enhance the shape of eyebrow, to thicken it, or to lengthen it, or broaden it up. Some people even remove or wax the entire eyebrows before drawing completely new ones from with the brow pencil, may be because they don’t like their eyebrows or may be they just want to try something new. Brow pencil comes in various types and colors. A pencil may have a thick end or a pointy end. Pointy-ended pencil is used to define details and outlines, while thick-ended pencil is used for applying makeup in large, base areas. In addition to the pencil, usually a brow pencil kit also contains tweezers to remove any stray hair, as well as a brow brush or comb to arrange the hair strands.\r\n\r\nI will be adding a more detailed article soon for my beauty supply on how to choose and use a brow pencil kit.\r\n\r\n12. <strong>Lipstick and Lip Gloss</strong>\r\nLipstick is like a wax applied on lips to change their color and texture to make the face look more attractive. Some lipsticks provide protection to lips as well in a similar way as lip balms.\r\n\r\nLip gloss is used to provide a lustrous or shiny finish and sometime a subtle color to the lips. They can have various types of metallic, glittery, frosted or glossy finishes.\r\n\r\nLipstick is usually applied for parties as well as formal settings, while lip gloss generally for parties, weekends and late nights. There are many more points about lipsticks and lip gloss that need to be covered. Stay tuned on my beauty supply.\r\n\r\n13. <strong>Nail Polish</strong>\r\n\r\nNail polish or paint is used to color the nails. Most of the time the terms nail polish and nail paint are used interchangeably, but some people prefer to call nail paint for the matte color while a nail polish for the lustrous or shiny color. This difference in terms is usually created by the brands and manufacturers. A nail paint gives an attractive look to the nails and is an important mark of makeup. Many women these days make creative designs on their nails using nail paints of different color instead of simply painting all the nails with one color. Since nail paints cannot be removed by simply by washing them, a special product called nail paint remover comes separate to assist with this task.\r\n\r\nI will be covering nails in more detail soon.\r\n\r\n14. <strong>Perfume</strong>\r\nPerfume is the last but most important part of this beauty supply article to complete our makeup kit. Perfume is a spray used to give a pleasant smell to the body. A make up seems to be incomplete without a good perfume. Once again, there are a variety of perfumes for different occasions that you can get. Not all perfumes go well on every personality and you have to experiment with several of them to see which one suits your personality. There are many tips and advises about perfumes that I will be covering in future articles.', 'Beauty Supply That A Girl Should Have In Stock', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '4-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-03-09 00:41:27', '2016-03-09 00:41:27', '', 4, 'http://localhost:8080/femina/index.php/2016/03/09/4-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Its a better alternative to bar soap and other skin cleansers because of various reasons such as:\r\n(i) Skin pH is about 4.7 where as soap has a high pH between 9-10, which can imbalance the skin pH thus causing further growth of bacteria increasing acne.\r\n(ii) Bar soap contains thickeners which clog up skin pores causing acne.\r\n(iii) Bar soap on the face removes natural oil which in turn causes sebaceous glands to overproduce oils causing acne. For these reasons, a facial cleanser is recommended instead of a soap to wash the face with. Usually, a cleanser is used as a part of skin care regimen in combination with a toner and a moisturizer.\r\n\r\nA cleanser is of utmost importance for the longevity of a healthy, acne-and-wrinkle-free skin along with some other anti-aging products especially if you put on heavy make-up very frequently.\r\n\r\nCleanser should be used twice a day, before and after sleep, because the skin gets affected from pollutants every day even within few hours and most cleansers are not harsh on skin.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on cleansers, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of cleansers soon for my beauty supply.\r\n\r\n2. <strong>Exfoliator</strong>\r\nAn exfoliator is basically like a soap or cream or lotion with granular particles in it which is applied or rubbed on the face and then washed off. It is used to remove dead and coarse skin cells from the face to make the skin smooth and soft.\r\n\r\nGentle or light exfoliator should be used once a day. However, since most exfoliators are not gentle, they should not be used more than once or twice a week.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on exfoliators, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of exfoliators soon for my beauty supply.\r\n\r\n3. <strong>Serum</strong>\r\nSerums are like moisturizers that provide active ingredients, antioxidants, hydrators and anti-inflammatories to the skin to keep it healthy and reduce its aging, wrinkles, and fine lines. Serums are quite concentrated and you have to be careful in using them, which I will cover in future articles. Serums are not necessary for a skin care regimen. However, if your skin has less problems, you have to wear less make-up to cover it up. Serums make your skin look healthier, radiant, younger and fresher. However, if you are suffering from Rosacea or eczema, you should avoid using a serum as it may cause aggravation.\r\n\r\nSerums should be used twice a day on regular basis. In the morning, the layer of sunscreen should be applied over the layer of serum, while at night a layer of moisturizer should be applied over the layer of serum.\r\n\r\nI will be covering more details on serums, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of serums soon for my beauty supply.\r\n\r\n4.<strong> Moisturizer</strong>\r\nMoisturizer is basically used to make the outer skin softer, smoother and more elastic, and to remove dryness through reducing evaporation. It contains natural or artificial oils, natural skin lipids and sterols, plant extracts, lubricants etc.\r\n\r\nMoisturizer should be used once or twice a day. But avoid using too much moisturizer at once as it could be more damaging than being healthy. Also, its important for you to know what type of ingredients your skin needs in a perfect moisturizer amongst the thousands that are available. Changing the type of moisturizer as your skin changes during various seasons of the year is also important. I have created another article to cover all such issues. I will be covering more details on moisturizers, tips and tutorials, and comparisons between different types of moisturizers soon.\r\n\r\nSome of my favorite moisturizers are:\r\n(i) Cetaphil Daily Moisturizer, which works well for me as well as many of my friends with normal or even excessively dry or super oily skin.\r\n(ii) Aveeno Natural Radiance, which is not as good but has thinner constituency and so its absorbed into the skin quickly, and it does make the skin look radiant indeed.\r\n\r\n5. <strong>Eye Cream</strong>\r\nSome people tend to not give special importance or any kind of priority to the skin surrounding the eyes. They feel that the other facial products will also take care of the eye skin. Besides, the eye creams are usually more expensive than other facial products. However, whether or not the eye cream fits in your budget, whether or not eye creams seem important to you, you should know a few things about why they exist at all.\r\n\r\nThe skin surrounding the eyes is more sensitive and fragile as compared to other areas, and its needs are totally different which regular facial products cannot fulfill. The skin around the eyes tends to age quicker, and is more prone to dryness and fatigue, thus forming dark circles easily. The eye cream is specifically designed to handle such issues by providing the area with proper elements that it needs most. I will be covering on eye creams in future articles for my beauty supply.\r\n\r\nWhether or not you want to focus on eye cream is upto you. However, if you do get one, you should use it once or twice a day. If you use once a day, use it at night.\r\n\r\n6. <strong>Foundation Or Tinted Moisturizer</strong>\r\nSo far we were only discussing about the products for our skin care regimen. Foundation is the first actual product from our beauty supply kit (or our makeup kit :P). Foundation is a skin-tinting pigment used to cover skin flaws and create a uniform complexion, or to change the color-tone of natural complexion. Foundation can be liquid or powder. Liquid foundation can be dewy or matte, while powder foundation can be illuminating or matte. If you suffer from dry skin or rosacea, try avoiding the powder and go for liquid, because powder will affect your skin negatively in long run. If you have oily skin, try to avoid dewy finish using a mix of liquid and powder foundations. I will be covering in future articles more on how to select and apply foundation.\r\n\r\nSome people have a misconception that tint-moisturizer is another skin care cream similar to other regular moisturizers or serums. However, when you match the ingredients of a foundation to those of a tint-moisturizer, you will notice striking similarities, such as use of solvent, mixtures of humectants and emollients, surfactants to keep the emulsion-type products mixed in a creamy base, ingredients to control the pH and thickness, skin toning pigments such as iron-oxide, titanium dioxide and mica, as well as preservatives to keep the product sanitized.\r\n\r\nSo a tint-moisturizer is basically a foundation. However, its a mild form of foundation since the amount of pigments used are usually less as compared to a foundation. Also, a tint-moisturizer hydrates skin better than a foundation due to higher concentration of humectants. Some brands’ foundation may act the same way as another brands’ tint-moisturizer though. So the two types of products vary a lot from brand to brand. You will have to figure out which type and brand works well for you depending on your preferences, skin type and season. But you definitely don’t need both products.\r\n\r\nIt should be obvious by now that tinted moisturizer shouldn’t be treated as a part of skin care regimen. Stay tuned on my beauty supply for more about foundations and tinted moisturizers.\r\n\r\n7. <strong>Concealer</strong>\r\nWhile foundation is used to even out the skin tone across your face, concealer is used to hide zits, dark circles or scars. In some cases, foundation is able to hide what you are trying to hide, but if it doesn’t, use a concealer. Concealer usually goes on top of foundation, if both concealer and foundation are used. However, if you are not wearing any make up and just need to hide the marks, you can use just concealer without any layer of foundation.\r\n\r\nI will be covering detailed tips in future articles on how to use concealers like a professional.\r\n\r\n8. <strong>Blush and Bronzer</strong>\r\nBlush, also called rouge, is used to redden the cheeks. Bronzer gives a suntan appearance to the skin, and contours and highlights the cheekbone. Sometimes, the application of blush and bronzer can amazingly change the features of the face.\r\n\r\nBronzer is usually applied before blush. There are several different types of blushes and bronzers. I will be writing more articles for my beauty supply on how to pick the right one for your skin and how to apply them.\r\n\r\n9. <strong>Eyeshadow and Eyeliner</strong>\r\nEye shadow is used to highlight or draw attention to the eyes, or to make them look attractive. It is applied on the upper eyelids, and sometimes even on the lower eyelids, and under the eyebrows. Different colors and different types of eye shadow provide difference look and feel. There are matte, liquid and shimmer and several other types. Shimmer is used for sexy look usually in parties, while matte is used for plain looks for more professional settings. I will be adding more information in future articles on how to choose the right type of eyeshadow and how to apply them here.\r\n\r\nEyeliner is used to emphasize or change the shape of the eye. The difference between eye shadow and eyeliner is that eye shadow is used recreate and design the frame of the eye as well as to throw in some colors, whereas the eyeliner is used only to change the shape of the eye. Eyeliner is applied close to contours or rim of the eye, while the eye shadow is applied in more outer areas as well. You can use either an eyeshadow or eyeliner, or even a combination of both during your makeup depending on your preferences. Usually lighter eyeliners provide better and more open looks to the eyes. I will be compiling another article to go deeper in this.\r\n\r\n10. <strong>Mascara</strong>\r\nMascara is used for thickening, coloring, enhancing, curling or even lengthening the eyelashes. It comes in various forms primarily liquid, cream and cake (or powder). It is important to choose the right type of mascara for the right occasion and duration. Most mascaras come with an applicator, but since there are so many different types of applicators available for applying mascara on eyelashes, you can get a specific type according to your preference. I will be adding a detailed article on how to pick the right mascara and an applicator, and how to apply it on eyelashes.\r\n\r\n11. <strong>Brow Pencil</strong>\r\nA brow pencil is like a regular pencil with makeup instead of lead. It is used to enhance the shape of eyebrow, to thicken it, or to lengthen it, or broaden it up. Some people even remove or wax the entire eyebrows before drawing completely new ones from with the brow pencil, may be because they don’t like their eyebrows or may be they just want to try something new. Brow pencil comes in various types and colors. A pencil may have a thick end or a pointy end. Pointy-ended pencil is used to define details and outlines, while thick-ended pencil is used for applying makeup in large, base areas. In addition to the pencil, usually a brow pencil kit also contains tweezers to remove any stray hair, as well as a brow brush or comb to arrange the hair strands.\r\n\r\nI will be adding a more detailed article soon for my beauty supply on how to choose and use a brow pencil kit.\r\n\r\n12. <strong>Lipstick and Lip Gloss</strong>\r\nLipstick is like a wax applied on lips to change their color and texture to make the face look more attractive. Some lipsticks provide protection to lips as well in a similar way as lip balms.\r\n\r\nLip gloss is used to provide a lustrous or shiny finish and sometime a subtle color to the lips. They can have various types of metallic, glittery, frosted or glossy finishes.\r\n\r\nLipstick is usually applied for parties as well as formal settings, while lip gloss generally for parties, weekends and late nights. There are many more points about lipsticks and lip gloss that need to be covered. Stay tuned on my beauty supply.\r\n\r\n13. <strong>Nail Polish</strong>\r\nNail polish or paint is used to color the nails. Most of the time the terms nail polish and nail paint are used interchangeably. However, some people prefer to call nail paint for the matte color while a nail polish for the lustrous or shiny color. This difference in terms is usually created by the brands and manufacturers. A nail paint gives an attractive look to the nails and is an important mark of makeup. Many women these days make creative designs on their nails using nail paints of different color instead of simply painting all the nails with one color. Since nail paints cannot be removed by simply by washing them, a special product called nail paint remover comes separate to assist with this task.\r\n\r\nI will be covering nails in more detail soon.\r\n\r\n14. <strong>Perfume</strong>\r\nPerfume is the last but most important part of this beauty supply article to complete our makeup kit. Perfume is a spray used to give a pleasant smell to the body. A make up seems to be incomplete without a good perfume. Once again, there are a variety of perfumes for different occasions that you can get. Not all perfumes go well on every personality. You have to experiment with several of them to see which one suits your personality. There are many tips and advises about perfumes that I will be covering in future articles.', 'Beauty Supply That A Girl Should Have In Stock', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '4-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-03-09 03:08:10', '2016-03-09 03:08:10', '', 4, 'http://localhost:8080/femina/index.php/2016/03/09/4-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);
